When I was doing my last publication, I couldn't imagine getting so many interesting questions that many asked what to buy at a sale (which, by the way, can still be caught by the tail). Let's figure out what things at a discount are worth paying attention to: 1. Basic, classic things that you're sure to use and don't get out of fashion. (Jeans, black pants with arrows, skirt pencil, etc.) 2. Things that can't be considered basic, but you like them very much. Okay. It's important to realize that maybe next year this thing will be irrelevant and we have to carry it now.  3. Things that can't be considered basic, but you realize that next season they're going to be trending.   If with the first two points, it's kind of understandable, then with the third, I'm sure there's been a problem.

275852,"​​🔜.Bracketchain is a new exciting technology that is somewhat similar to blockchain technology but utilizes reflective holographic imagery to validate transactions. Bracketchain actually utilizes a holographic ledger to process transactions nearly at light speed in comparison to traditional blockchains like Bitcoin Ethereum and Binance. Bracketchains technology basically changes the way how a traditional blockchains validate transactions from changing the speed of transactions from processing speed to imagery speed by utilizing web 3.0 photo technology and Bracketchains holograhicledger. The sturcture of the Bracketchain is similar to blockchain but with more comfort for the system to operate at an optimal speed, let me explain. Similar to blockchain Bracketchain has a set number of nodes that are referred to as Virtual banks. The first layer of Bracketchain is activated when the Virtual Banks begin to communicate similar to nodes, the difference is every Virtual Bank has a holographinc version of the entire NFT and cryptographic hash which is referred to as cash. They communicate through a set of reflections which is creating a digital hologram confrimed by every Virtual bank all at once in an instant through a complicated set of algorythims to validate updates to the holographic ledger. New Cash (hash) is then deposited in the digital hologramsa new update is needed then the cycle starts again and confirmed instantly.  🔶 Token Information:  Token Name:     BCK Token Type:       BEP20 Binance Token Price:      1 BNB = ~700 BCK Total Supply:     21,000,000 BCK  🔶 BRACKET COIN is carrying out a Pre-Sale at the moment.

275867,"Shot over 35 days on the streets of Peckham in the U.K., KevCoin: The Movie is filmed in a mockumentary style, with many real people playing themselves and being co-opted into the film. The plot centers around Kevin Powder as he attempts to build his own cryptocurrency, which he can use to fund his latest movie idea and boost its reputation.Attar told Bitcoin Magazine,  “This is the second of three films. We want the next film to be shot in Detroit, where Kevin finds real people to create the world’s biggest crypto-party to end all parties. We will only do this if we find suitable cash resources to film the project. Ideally, the funds will come from how we develop KevCoin in the future, and possibly doing some kind of fundraising involving our token.”Indeed, lead actor Attar is already looking ahead to the next movie in the series. “We do, in fact, have one very strong idea around this already, and depending on the success of this project, we could possibly start this next phase in 2019. It is all dependent on making KevCoin: The Movie work and learning from it. We’re merely experimenting at this point, but we will start to firm up our plans in the near future for a platform that connects audiences to independent films in a social way.”KevCoin: The MovieThe story begins when Kevin’s girlfriend, Bianca, finally breaks it off after months of instability. Finding himself in between homes and looking to start fresh, Kevin gets his hands on a small camper van and heads out to the nearby city of Peckham, a gritty southeast region of London stuffed with nightclubs, bars and other seedy hangouts. During this time, Kevin decides to take his love of science fiction to a new level by creating his own fantasy film, which he’ll call The Day Peckham Stood Still. Unfortunately, the movie industry is tougher than it looks, and not everyone’s enthused by his idea, leaving Kevin to find a new route to fund his project. It isn’t long before he gets the idea to build a trillion-dollar token — a path that bears more foul-ups than fortune. The focus of the film is KevCoin, a real cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token. The film’s premiere is set for Wednesday, June 27, 2018, in London, after which it will be released directly to the crypto community the following day. Those interested in seeing the film can visit "

275895,"It's time to talk about the fall-winter trends. Let's start with the brightest trend, velvet. I suggest you avoid being too parade. Dilution velvet cajual style -- that's really cool -- there's two velvet things in my fall shopping list -- a free rabbit jacket (I want to wear it with white blouse and jeans clasps, just like Ralph Lauren's on display) and a dress. Trying to go shopping on this subject was very depressing -- in my favorite Zara everything is weird, there are two and a half velvet things in Mango (and they're not the same), a Topshop jacket didn't sit down on me. I was already desperate, but the guys at the boo store sent me their velvet dress for a review. Luckily, or unfortunately, I'm not an Insta-girl who's desperate for everything she gets into her hands -- I've got everything from my heart and kidneys, as they say -- but the dress that I've been looking for -- a beautiful, complex color, sitting on the figure -- it's made of quality. I'm happy. If it weren't for the very gifted CDEK couriers, everything would be perfect at all. I'm gonna wear over a diver with tight black tights and braids, and you guys are gonna meet the Instagram of the guys-- "

275926,"I finally got to my shoes. I'll start with the men's room. (The girls who read me are sending my men's posts to their acquaintances, aren't they?) It's my custom to take out the emoji, because the boys don't like them very much.   First, a little lyrical retreat: I've got men I know, and many of them think that warm shoes are for the weak. Maybe if you're only moving by car. But in any case, at least buy some furs in your cold shoes. No one needs health problems, right?   One more thing. I don't insist, but it would be better if your winter shoes were just above the ankle. I don't want the snow to fall asleep.   Materials: Skin (better natural), tarpaulin. I don't recommend it. It can crack on the cold. And do not forget the provision of shoes.  Before buying winter shoes, appreciate your way of life. And you're gonna decide how you're gonna dress more often, sports day by day or more classically. That's what we're gonna do: the main styles that fit the sports-time style: • the Timberlands (and everything they look like). By the way, they're not only beige-coloured (like a picture up on the left), they're black, for example.  • fur sneakers. Because the manufacturers of sports shoes love us.  • Martins-like shoes (maybe the martins themselves are in the picture on the left downstairs with a yellow loop).  • Army-style shoes. with the minimum amount of fermentation. It's like a picture upstairs on the right.   The main styles that fit the classical style (with jeans can also be): • classical boots on cords. Note that they sometimes have lightning on the side — with a strict classical costume — that looks strange.  • Chicks. They're such tall boots with no bandages on their sides. They look better with a little baked trousers/ jeans.  Classical shoe nuances: Black boots fit a strict dress code. The brown ones are for more relaxed classical images. Perforation (as in a picture with three pairs of identical boots) is for stylists.   They asked me about the men's uggies. Yes, sir. Of course I don't mind. But if she had seen her husband in them, she would have cut off his legs. That's the positive note I've decided to end up on."

275948,"about the women's shoes. First of all, sad (or not very much): 1. There is no brand in which absolutely all the shoes fit everyone — all the legs are different. But many shoe stamps try to make sculptors with different pads. For different clients. So now every man has a chance to find his perfect pair of shoes. But you have to measure. It's a lot to measure.  2. It is pointless to look for winter shoes in a mass market. this is such a sad and short point.   Now about trends: 1. length of tibia: half boots; boots that end exactly under the knee; botforts; 2. heel: square, stable. Any height. In fashion, interesting transparent heels and heels with metal glitter (but it's all for an amateur, of course); 3... nose shape: look at the picture, I've tried to include different options in it; 4.. materials: colour lock at the peak of popularity (flower options: brown, potter's clay colour, wine, dark green, dark blue, deep gray). Snake and leopard Prince materials. Lacquer is fashionable, but I don't recommend it for the winter. (I already wrote that he could crack on the cold.) And the usual smooth skin wasn't canceled; 5. decor: the best decor is the absence of the decor (I'm not joking). If you wish, you can experiment with heels (para. 2). in fashion active decor with embroidery or crystals (but it's for desperate fashion women).   Sports boots/brutal boots also exist. I'm gonna write about women's uggies that I don't wear them myself, but if I see a girl in neat short uggs, five out of ten times I'm not gonna faint.   And you know I like more than dressing up. The right thing to do is eat. and Canal "

276010,"The question from the reader is: ""Inspired by your last post. And now I want to give my girlfriend an ornament on March 8th. I don't think it's good enough to give you a jewelry, I don't make any money yet, and I've already given Pandora. I'd appreciate it if you could tell me where you can buy beautiful jewelry at a normal price. And it'll be great if you write a couple of advices of your choice.""  I say, first of all, the advice of choice: 1. Remember which jewelry a girl wears more often — gold or silver, with or without stones. This will help to determine the future; 2. The simplest option is suspension or brooch. 'Cause there's no way to guess with size; 3. it's pretty dangerous to get rings: if you're not married, there might be a conflict, and there might be a big/small ring (but there's a genre of a regulated ring); 4. Even if you think that giving an ornament in a velvet box in the form of a red rose is a great idea, don't do it. For me, the best way to get an ornament is to ask a girl to close her eyes and just put it on her.   where to buy: there are now many brands that make cute and cheap jewelry of gold, silver, bronze, or brass. Many of them are on the Lambada Market website (there's been a lot of crap lately, but you can choose the good ones) and in Saharka. links to sites and collections more or less win-win options:   "

But in this fuss, you have to remember to dress up for New Year's Eve:) I'll start with men, I think I know two main men's reasons for buying a suit — prom and wedding. What do you do if the prom is long gone and the weddings aren't scheduled? That's right! I'm gonna give myself a New Year's costume. Let's just have it. I've just had a friend buy a fracco, just to be (a great man's stunt, I think). The only requirement for pants is that they sit well (always warning that dozens of models will need to be measured). And the jacket's gonna have to be beautiful as well. If the dress code of the event allows, you do not have to wear a shirt and tie/butt with a costume.  You can wear a diver (especially looks good with two-bore jackets) or a T-shirt (why not?).   If the suit is for you, buy a jacket. Anything interesting, invoiced. The most universal models are Tweed (this jacket can be easily adapted to your daily wardrobe in the future because it looks great with almost everything). Make a holiday look with a jacket based on the format of the event. Possible options include: •pidge + bracelets + chops + balls / butterfly + bots; • pijac + bracelets/ jeans + bots/cooks; • pijac + bracelets/ jeans + water-+bots/cades; • pijac+brooks/ jeans + hoods + kettles.   If you don't want to have fun in your jacket, take a good look at the vests. You can wear them in the same combination as your jackets.   It's also possible to create a stylish image with a sweater or a bullet:)"

This, in turn, increases the amount of work done by Pablotoken in the market. When the number of tokens in circulation increases, each token's value will diminish, which is why Pablotoken uses the concepts of deflationary and burning, there will never be more Pablotoken in circulation than there are now.

Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn’t been released. So, “zero-day” refers to the fact that the developers have “zero days” to fix the problem that has just been exposed — and perhaps already exploited by hackers.  Once the vulnerability becomes publicly known, the vendor has to work quickly to fix the issue to protect its users. But the software vendor may fail to release a patch before hackers manage to exploit the security hole. That’s known as a zero-day attack."

276345,"Figure 1: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Symmetrical Triangle Breakdown The implications of this consolidation pattern breaking down have potentially devastating ramifications for the crypto market across the board. With patterns like a symmetrical triangle, there is a measured move that will give insight into a potential price target that will play out upon the breakout. In our case the measured move is a staggering $5,500 move. If the triangle had broken to the top, we could have expected to see a $5,500 move to the top. However, since we broke to the bottom of this pattern, we could potentially be heading for prices ranging from $1,500 - $3,000. Whether that target becomes fully realized remains to be seen, but those prices are not out of the question.When we look at current support levels that may impede the downward motion, a few tests need to be broken before the full-fledged bearish pressure really begins to manifest in the market. Our previous low at $6,450 was the lower boundary of an accumulation trading range that caused the market to make a very sizeable rally, testing the $10,000 range. Breaking this price level would undoubtedly send a cascade of stop-market orders, as this is a line-in-the-sand-type of price level: It’s where the bears previously decided they would no longer sell below that range and where the bulls decided it was a good entry point for long positions. If the $6,450 price levels fail to hold up the market, the next immediate test will be the v-bottom we saw back in February that tested the lower $6,000s. There was a very high level of buyer interest at that level, and it was a level where aggressive short sellers covered and caused a rally. If we manage to break that level, we enter a high likelihood of deeper tests of market support where we will need to zoom out even further on our market view:"

I'll tell you a terrible secret: in principle, to be aware of fashion trends, it's enough to buy two issues of a favorite magazine a year — September (Spring Winter Trends) and March (Spring Summer Trends). These are the numbers that are considered the main ones, and most of the information in them is not sucked out of their fingers.   With books, it's harder to read books in style, just for interest. Because most of them are either of no use at all or include outdated information. If I find any super-book, I'll tell you. But the books on fashion history can be read. I suggest you start with an encyclopedia. After reading, you will probably be interested in specific designers — read about them separately (VOGUE has a good series)."

And this is how to get to the office on the evil cold street -- it's already a question -- the simplest and most fashionable answer I've seen at the fall winter show of Saint Lawrence -- you can just combine your boots with your high boots or your high boots. It looks very stylish. If you don't have a goal of reducing your legs and distorting your proportions, I suggest you choose your shoes in the tone of your pants.

But most of the people I know, I'm just hearing something like, ""Oh, I went into Zara, I freaked out about the mess and the number of people, I didn't buy anything, and I left.""

When I make a responsible decision, what trends will be added to my fashion arsenal, I look into the eyes of my reflection in the mirror and honestly answer the following questions: ♪ Is that right for me? How am I gonna put this in my style? What am I gonna wear this with?   So, what trends I've chosen for myself in the summer of 2016: - pajama style - all kinds of dressings and bananas in the face - open shoulders - blue - double-brown jackets - sarapans on top of T-shirts - wide trousers - vertical strip - tiny flower prince - the punk style elements produce a very long text.

In detail, I can imagine how to make sure that he sits well, is comfortable, and goes to the majority.  At the same time, it's almost impossible to find a perfect sweatshop in the shops. For some reason, no one's making them too much. Although it's the basic element of clothing that everyone really needs. The other day, I had to find one for my client, and I thought I'd try to release the shipment myself.   And I know what a sweatshirt should look like, but I don't know anything about making clothes, and I'm looking for people to help me with that.  And that's why the announcement.

276609,"Internet is just a network of networks in the only way it works globally is because these networks are willing to give each other access into each others network through peering or transit connections or place it called internet exchange points.  True privacy freaks and anonymity-philes can take things to an extreme level, though. To become untraceable, you could try the following: 1. To use the internet without registering with an ISP, buy an internet hotspot. To prevent any record of you buying it, get a friend to buy it for you, in cash. 2. As soon as you get online, connect to the Tor network. 3. From there, create an email account with an encrypted email service using fake personal information. 4. Then, find a VPN service that accepts payment in cryptocurrency, and sign up for that with your fake email and anonymous payment. Connect to the VPN. 5. Now you can use Tor browser or a secure browser in private mode to surf anonymously. Even with all of these precautions, a dedicated sleuth (or NSA agent) could still find a way to identify you using time lapse between entry or exit nodes.  Pretty extreme, right? The above process would also make for an extremely slow browsing experience. It’s what some whistleblowers, journalists, or those living under oppressive regimes have to do.  Privacy is different as compared to anonymity. anonymity shield your identity privacy hides your activity. people are not enhancing their privacy they just delegating the trust to other companies."

Pay more attention to the woolen — they keep their shape well and look modern. When we talk about color, there are rules that I wrote about yesterday.  Knock on the badge or the brook. And it's gonna play with new colors and the beret has a great option -- you can hide your hair in it when it's snow on the street -- almost all the stamps in this season offer us berets (i.e., you've seen them in Zara and Asos at very humane prices)."

The fur coats are bought for more than one season (if you're not rich, of course). When I choose a coat for myself, I would buy a completely basic (a-la robe or straight line), from a hole, without a hood, with sleeves of standard length, with a minimum visible furry (without all this streaky-perlamutarian madness). I'd wear it to a hole. Because it's a classic if you're normal with artificial fur (i.e. I'm normal; and the leopard from the former post is also ) you can buy yourself a perfectly budgeted fur coat. Of course, it's not gonna be hot, but it's the same:) in a trend of coloured fur with a long ox. All that matters is that he doesn't look like a ditched soft toy from his grandmother's antresols.  If the coat is too much for you, buy a fur scarf. They come from natural and artificial furs, too. I really like this genre. Such scarfs look great with a coat. The shoe post will be here soon.

You will have to pay half in advance so that they can buy CC to use it for carding.   When you pay them the half amount they will go to Amazon, Flipkart website & make the purchase of the item that you require on your address. When it come the page of Payment they will just provide any fake number of credit card which are available on internet & other fake details & proceed to pay.  Now because it takes some time to verify details, Amazon will book the product & mark as Preparing to Dispatch. So they will take this screenshot and send you saying they have done their work and your product will arrive in 4-5 days, now you will have to pay the remaining half. If you don't they say they will cancel the order and will never work with you again.  Because you have seen the screenshot of Amazon, you will believe them and pay them the other half & wait for your product.  But in real, within 30 minutes Amazon will cancel the order because their system has confirmed that payment has not been made yet. Now because they ordered it from their email you won't get this notification of order cancellation.

But today I write not only for girls, but also for boys, let's talk about the most basic (in my opinion) part of the basic wardrobe, the white T-shirt. A lot of people think a white T-shirt is boring, and they want to buy something that's so coloured and nice, but just believe me, a white T-shirt is stylish and you have to have it. Of course, not all white T-shirts are equally useful. Let's figure out what the basic white T-shirt should be to take an honorary place in your wardrobe: 1. as simple as possible. free of additional parts, decor, drawings and pristines; 2. direct croya (but not too constrictive) length up to the pelvic bone; 3. cotton of sufficient density. In order to prevent girls from reading underwear and boys from having nipples (pardon); 4. with round cut or shallow v-shaped. The v-cut extends the neck visually and reduces the shoulders (it's just for reference); 5. white base T-shirt does not have to be expensive because it's rather expendable. It's better to have a neat thing on you than a sweetheart. You can buy yourself from a mass market (""Yours"", ""Sela"", ""H&M"""" from 299♪).  What are you wearing? Absolutely with anything, a white T-shirt is a universal thing: just with jeans (of course it's boring, but it's possible), with all the top clothes, with the costumes, with any ""complex"" things, and so on, made for you an endless set of ideas. Today, as I promised, both girls and boys are happy:"

If a person suddenly feels like he has a taste problem, it is no reason to cross over simply to pay attention to what is around us, to what we are looking at.

So pick a small or give up on it for a while (exclude - vertical strip); • well-paint the dark trousers of the straight rabbit with high/medium landing and arrows; a-silhouette skirts (with the same planting); v-cut or odour clothing; • give up too tight and too free silhouettes (in the first place I feel like a silhouette in a natural shell and in the second I feel like a large cloud). Let your garments flow in the shape; and give preference to dense tissue. I advise you to give up the thin tricutage (he will strongly emphasize the extra bulge); • pick up the top and bottom of the set in the same color saturation — you will seem taller and thinner; • well, the simplest move is to put on a bright/light top (with any bottom) or dress, and on top of it is a dark long jacket/heart/cardigan of a straight croe, and do not twist it; • I went to drink my kephyr, and I'll leave you with a picture of the Mango site for skill training.

277359,"Malvertising is the use of online advertising to spread malicious code or malware. malvertising comprises injection malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate websites/ portals.  How does it works ? 🧑🏻‍💻  1.) Pre-click malware :- The user no need to click on the advertisement to be a Victim of malvertising. Examples of pre- click malware 🥢 - Auto-run, as in the case of auto redirects, where the user is automatically taken to a different site, which could be malicious. - Driven by Downloads - unintentional download of a virus or malicious software onto your computer or mobile device.  2.) Post-Click  malware :- The user has to click on the advertisement for it to install malicious content on the system.

I'm looking at the average severity of the Dresscod (not one that is ""only a blue pantsuit in a strip of a width"" but not a jean) — you can easily adapt my advice to your own senses, starting with the simplest — how to warm the top. Attention is drawn to the following elements of the wardrobe: • diving. It's fashionable and warm. A diver in the cold of the year can easily replace a shirt — it can be worn on its own or under something (anything:). Guys, you can have divers too, even if you need them; • jumper/winder (this is also an option for men). With a round or v-cut, which one you like best and what goes. You can wear it on your own (but with some bottom of it, of course) and you can wear it under it with a diver or shirt (in which case you can take it off if it gets hot) • a jacket/jacket (suitable for a man and a woman's wardrobe). Very nice if it's made of wool-added fabric. It's better if he's straight, that's how he's gonna be; • cardigan. It's a nice thing (which, by the way, can just be put off at work in the event of a sudden ice age). Special features of a fashion cardigan: direct croi, no clamping, and also good if it's long; • vest. My favorite part of the wardrobe at any time of the year, because it instantly makes the image complete and stylish (and it also builds). In order for the vest to be made, it must be made from a cloth with wool added.   warm up in style."

If this is not possible, then, of course, you can buy the most universal version of the jacket, the straight silhouette, the length to the pelvic bone (plus or minus a couple centimetres), but you can also try on long models.   The ideal trousers are a high/medium landing (to make the legs look longer), the presence of arrows (to make the same legs look thinr), and the length to the ankles. Why the ankles? I'm telling you, this length will allow you to wear your pants with absolutely any shoes. Can you pick longer pants? - you can, but right after you buy it, you're gonna have to make a voluntary decision, which shoes you're gonna wear, by the way, you know what the coolest thing about costumes is? - that you can divide tops and bottoms and create a lot of stylish sets that you don't really want to save on a costume. It's a serious thing, though. But I've tried to choose the right options for you with a good balance of appearance, price, and quality:"

278036,"Figure 2: BTCUSD, 1 Day Candles, Fibonacci Retracement Values If we draw out the Fibonacci retracement set for this entire parabolic run-up, we see a potentially strong level of support around the 78% retracement (the $4,500 range). Historic parabolic run-ups have, at maximum, retraced to the 78% range before ultimately bottoming. To me, this area is a strong zone of observation and not necessarily a zone of action as the price target of the aforementioned symmetrical triangle is well below that.It’s very important to keep in mind this is all hypothetical and contingent upon the market response to the various support levels. At the time of this article, we are currently testing the strength of the first, initial, crucial support level.Summary:Bitcoin broke down out of a large, multi-month symmetrical triangle. The measured move of this breakout lies roughly between the $1500 - $3000 range. There are various levels of support outlined in this article that all need to considered and analyzed on a case-by-case basis, as they potentially could result in a cryptomarket-wide, devastating downward continuation.

278493,"  Bitbondex is a global online P2P marketplace making it easy for anyone to issue, exchange, and invest in bonds using crypto-asset collateral. By leveraging blockchain technology, you can securely access better issuance, settlement, and custody of your bonds.  Investors who buy bonds on Bitbondex are lending money to those issuing the bond.  Rather than funding the whole loan, you can buy tokens representing shares of the bond by browsing bonds listed on Bitbondex. We'll help you build a diverse investment portfolio that suits your financial goals and risk tolerance.   Once a bond is issued, it's automatically listed on the exchange. Bondholders can easily trade their listed bonds for other assets like fiat money or cryptocurrency. And it will create a secure token with a unique identity using the ERC-1155 standard. When you buy bond security on Bitbondex, you're buying the tokenized bond representing shares of the bond on the Bitbondex platform.   Bondholders can transfer these tokens to each other and trade/exchange it on the secondary bond market. You can even use it as collateral to issue new bonds.   More information:  Website: "

It's all done at Mudle on our class page. A big request not to delete these files and save students access to them, all of which will come in handy next semester. Moreover, it would be convenient simply to keep filling in what is already in place, not to create something new. We'll try to make our course easier next semester. Well, it's not so much easier than trying to be more popular with things that aren't simple, but important. And, of course, it's important that students work independently with what we recommend to them. We carefully select and prepare these materials (example attached to the letter). P.S. We're gonna try to read our course next semester so that the guys who didn't have our course last semester are able to listen to it. But the maximum benefit will still be for those students who have already attended our course last semester. Tremba-Dorn_Gronzova-Dirty will also try to read the course from scratch.

If you have a chance, please elaborate on the men's silhouette pants with the waist rubber: with and without, with the rubber on the end of the pants (joggers) and without, with the costume cloth or tricutage. Where's the line when the pants of ""quiet"" relatively basic forms turn into ""sports"" of 100% polyester for ""guys from our yard""? What's the top of a pair of pants and what shoes? Can we go out for a walk in town or go to the airport and go somewhere? Or is it the road from home to the gym? ""Thank you."" Answer: ""The most universal jogers are: - costume fabric; - arrows; - no rubber band at the end of the pants; - preferably no bandage on the waist.  You can wear pants like this in almost any situation with clothes and shoes. They're very comfortable. You can usually buy it easy at Massimo Dutti, which I told you about in the last girl's post (it's going to be around 8k, it's going to pay for itself), but there are other shops where they are (sometime the perfect joggers were found by me in Reserved for 1.5k).   The cutting at the end of our pants immediately limits us to a set of shoes (braces/keds). But these pants (if they're not tricottage/polyester) can fit perfectly into the daily ""non-work"" wardrobe. T-shirts/stuffers/cuts may be worn on top.   Tricutors and joggers (may be with a rubber band at the end of a pants or without) — only for relaxing walks and sports — can also be found at the airport:) Combining with sports items and basic Cades/Timberlands.   The polyester joggers, I advise you to choose without a rubber band at the end of your pants, otherwise it's gonna be a fair sport.   I hope she did."

The subject remains the same, just the letters and pictures will be a little smaller, and the posts will be bigger. I don't promise much to men, but neither will I.

278949,"There's been a lot of questions lately from the girls about what to wear to the office in the summer, if the dress code isn't too strict, but you want to look good. I'm telling you, 1. Pliss/a-silhouette/scent skirt. In normal pencil skirts, the summer is often hot and uncomfortable; 2. Bright dicks and light tissue. Choose high-plant models and not too broad; 3. White cotton shirt. Let's just fill it in at any bottom; 4. Tops. Pick the tops from the lung tissue of a straight unseating silhouette. Let there be air between the cloth and the body; 5. It's a straight shirt, it's quite a free rabbit. Pull up your sleeves and fill your shirt downstairs; 6. The vest. A very comfortable thing is an extra layer without onion warming. Choose the vest from the laughter cloth so that it doesn't wiggle hard; 7. A light jacket. I recommend that we just hang it in the office and wear it to meetings and meetings (good, air conditioning is everywhere) 8. New boats/bones. They're gonna go to any set, and they're gonna build and make your legs longer.   I use old-fashioned pictures because many people complained that they couldn't see anything in an instant view. Guys, if you need a post like this, write to me."

There you can find minimalistic basic things from young (and not very) designers. The prices aren't super-cost (average value of 10 tons), but it's not a mass market as if.

278968,"🗃 Password cracking technique 🗳 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ There are a number of techniques that can be used to crack passwords. We will describe the most commonly used ones below :  🌀Dictionary attack  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method involves the use of a wordlist to compare against user passwords.  🌀Brute force attack ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method is similar to the dictionary attack. Brute force attacks use algorithms that combine alpha-numeric characters and symbols to come up with passwords for the attack. For example, a password of the value “password” can also be tried as p@$$word using the brute force attack.  🌀Rainbow table attack ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ This method uses pre-computed hashes. Let’s assume that we have a database which stores passwords as md5 hashes. We can create another database that has md5 hashes of commonly used passwords. We can then compare the password hash we have against the stored hashes in the database. If a match is found, then we have the password.  🌀Guess  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ As the name suggests, this method involves guessing. Passwords such as qwerty, password, admin, etc. are commonly used or set as default passwords. If they have not been changed or if the user is careless when selecting passwords, then they can be easily compromised.  🌀Spidering ━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Most organizations use passwords that contain company information. This information can be found on company websites, social media such as facebook, twitter, etc. Spidering gathers information from these sources to come up with word lists. The word list is then used to perform dictionary and brute force attacks. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━  ➖"

You can wear pants/ jeans with pants of the width that will allow you not to fill them in your shoes (this works if the tibia is not too large/high); you can wear more dresses/skirts with dense dark claws is warm and fashionable; • if you really like this genre, that's what it's worth to pay attention: jeans should be of dense material and stretch well; well, no extended/lost knees; I hope that I have not injured anyone in this post.

You can also ask me a question about something you're interested in: "
279300,I'm continuing to share with you the Instagrams of Stylish Girls:
279301,"I started coming from girls with more and more questions about the upcoming spring and summer fashion trends. I'm going to do a lot of material on this subject with detailed collections, but a little bit later. While you're at it, catch a little scribbler. I've included those trends that are the easiest to adapt to the basic wardrobe. 'Cause Maria Antoinette's style is beautiful, but not every day. I note separately that there was a lot of pink on the podiums, ranging from pasta to fuchsia; 2. If you want to be a fashion model, choose the most gypsy options; 3. stripes. Vertical or horizontal, c/b or coloured, broad or narrow; 4. peas. Any color and size. It's important that he be on a black background. I'm gonna write about the Princes briefly. The bigger the Prince, the more likely it's gonna be to fill you up (for someone it's good and for someone it's bad to decide for yourself); 5. white semi-translucent dresses. The more transparent, the more fashionable. But I'm in favour of safe options; 6.. costumes in male style. In a trend of volume models and hypertrophied shoulder lines (but this case can distort the proportions of the figure, so be careful -- you can get rid of the normal two-brace jacket of the straight croy); 7... sports style (by the way, the peak is gonna be a Polo T-shirt). It is important not to forget to dilute it with non-sports; 8. If your overalls were to be locked from the front to the lightning, it's actually fine; 9. And the sweetest and simplest is the heart. in all variations (print, patch, brooch, etc.)))."

Sn is the cost of iteration, so after T = 1a * ln(1/e) iterations (with error <=e) we get the vector p we need. How did you get this T?

Light insisted that I evaluate the quality and landing before I published this post, brought me a sample of the dress. And you know what? It's luxurious. Here's every penny you get. 100% silk, wide open, seams okay. I've never seen such a delicate and neat swing in a similar price category. Lighta told me they're processing the same technology as Hermès. Anyway, it's been a while since I've felt so beautiful about things.   On the webinar, I'm gonna tell you how well I can put this dress in the fall wardrobe, and I'm gonna give all the participants a drink that they can buy for 5,800 or 7,800. If you buy a dress, the webinar itself will get you free of charge (in the sense that the amount of the discount will ""recover"" its cost) Not all things have been taken off, it's better to clarify the existence.

3141592,"  One of the largest non-castodial exchanges is the crypt of CyberSwap leaving Malta and moving to the British Virgin Islands in the light of the entry into force of the EU Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5). It's written by The Block.  As required by the Directive, European crypto companies should introduce customer identification measures and report any suspicious activity to the responsible authorities.  CyberSwap is currently working in Malta, and operations in the new jurisdiction will begin on 24 January. According to the exchange, ""new requirements would be too high a barrier for most traders, both in terms of regulation and costs"".  So from next week, KyberSwap will not be the Maltese Cyber Network International Limited, but KYRD International Limited, its sister company located in the British Virgin Islands. At the same time, there will be no change in the management and team of the stock exchange.  Kyber Network is now second among all non-castodial exchanges, only slightly below Uniswap."

3141607,"The South Korean corporation Samsung Electronics announced on this Tuesday a self-contained security solution based on the S3FV9RR chip and a specialized software, one of whose applications is called cryptoval transactions.  ""In an era of mobile and unconnected interaction, we expect network devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to maintain a high level of security to protect personal data and carry out activities in financial space, including mobile banking, stock trading and cryptative transactions,"" said the Senior Vice-President for Marketing, Samsung System LSI Donho Shin.  According to the company, the new chip exceeds the safety level of the first generation solution announced in February.  ""The autonomous solution consists of a Security Element (SE) chip (S3FV9RR) and improved protective software, which has resulted in the highest-level certification for mobile components – Common Critheria Evolution Association Level (CC EAL) 6+,"" says the company. - CC EAL 6+ is used in scenarios that require the strictest safety conditions, e.g. electronic passports and hardware wallets are cryptized.  The new chip has a double storage capacity and supports the hardware root of trust (RoT), safe download and authentication. According to the company, the mechanisms presented are capable of ""protection of the device against any possible attacks or unauthorized updates of the software"".  The chip is scheduled for the third quarter of this year."
3141608,"  The perpetrators stole more than 1.4 million XRPs ($230,000) with the fraudulent expansion of the Ledger Live for Chrome browser. This was reported by Twitter user xrpforensics.  The expansion is being promoted by advertising in Google's search engine. It has nothing to do with Ledger's hardware wallet manufacturer.  Once it is installed by the user, it accesss the code phrases to restore the wallets and transmits them to the intruders, who, based on these phrases, generate the keys and remove the cryptals.  ""In the last month alone, they stole more than 200,000 XRPs,"" says the report.  Subsequently, xrpforensics wrote that the real amount could be much larger. It could have been stolen, and there were other crypts, but he didn't have any information about it.  If you look at the principle of expansion in more detail, it can be found that it sends a request to transmit user data to its server.  If users do not want to be caught by fraudster tricks, it is recommended that tools to handle hardware wallets be downloaded only from the manufacturer's website.  Another fraudulent scheme related to the theft of XRP is distributed online. The perpetrators created YouTube Channel, which offers 50 million XRPs on behalf of the Director General of the Ripple Brad Garlinghouse. Some 277,000 people have already signed into the network. There's only one video on it offering a fake distribution. It was downloaded on March 19, and over 85,000 views in six days. The intruders were tricky enough because the video included real footage of Garlinghouse's interview he gave last month."

3141611,"A partner of the ParaFi Capital Foundation, Santiago Roel Santos, in a recent interview, described his company's strategy to invest in the growing decentralized financial space (DeFi). He explained that the fund held several key items and complemented them with more risk rates at an early stage.  ""We want to make a lot of bets on key implementation scenarios that we think will still show themselves and have a marketable product. We have a pretty focused briefcase. We probably have about 10 of the most key positions in the lion's share of the portfolio. We also have experimental positions where we entered very, very early,"" said Joel Santos.  He also reported that ParaFi devotes a lot of attention to project research before making an investment decision: ""We are guided by the subject matter. By the time we talk to the founder, we already know whether this space needs insurance, capital markets, derivative markets, or the ability to currentize and distribute risks. We're actively looking for teams like this. Once we find them, it makes it easier for us to determine whether the team is worthy of them, whether they have the necessary technical skills and competence to invest in them.""  At the same time, Roel Santos admitted that investing in DeFi remained an extremely risky activity. ""I'm not ready to say it's Myspace, Facebook, or Google. I think it's too early for that. I'm not ready to make that statement. I can only make a lot of bets. I think one of the key attractive features of this space is the ability to constantly check your assumptions,"" he added.  In making investment decisions, ParaFi Capital calls for the use of lock-in-level data analysis tools: ""In real time, right now you can see the number of liquidations or loans in Computer or Aave, the number of users. I think it's the biggest paradigm shift in investing in this space. You can estimate the growth of these networks in real time and financially support your assumption.""  As of August 31, 2020, ParaFi Capital had over $100 million in management from investors such as Bain Capital Ventities and Henry Kravis from KKR. In September, the foundation attracted the capital of Galaxy Digital Holdings Mike Novogratz. The portfolio of ParaFi Capital consists of 1inchexchange, RAMP DEFI, Synthetix, Acala Network, Company, Aave, Uniswap, MackerDAO, DefiDollar, DewersiFi and other DeFi projects."

3141613," His new tweets are an eccentric crypto-dick, John Makafi, admitted that his project for a confidential Ghost coin partially copied a whitepaper other pencilized confidential coin, PIVX.  No, MacAfi seems to be going to sue the creators of the PIVX for spreading depraved information.  This week, PIVX developers stated that the whitepaper Ghost was a plagiarist of an outdated 2018 PIVX document. They claimed that ""20 of the 26 pages"" of the Whitepaper Ghost ""containing direct plagiarism from the Whitepaper PIVX 2018"".  The representative of Ghost told Cointelegraph that the source code base of the coin was PIVX fork, although the Ghost code allegedly already contained ""a lot of improvements"".  The PIVX developers also claim that their witepaper is ""fully copyrighted in 2018"" and is not reimbursable.  However, John Makafi seems to want PIVX to be held responsible for slander: ""PIVX is trying to claim that their source code is a public domain, while the description of how it works is not. According to the creators, the product is compensatory, and the documentation, according to the creators, is fraudulent. It's pretty simple. I'm gonna show it in court soon."" When asked by a commentator on Twitter about whether there was a plagiarism, Makafi replied: ""Of course he was! The document explains what the code that they have released is doing!!!! You're recording the way from home to the pizzeria? Wake up! I don't do that kind of nonsense either.""  In a conversation with Cointelegraph about a possible lawsuit, PIVX developers explained that ""PIVX is not a legal person"".  ""It's like John would sue for bitcoin,"" they said.  They also recalled that John McAfi &apos; s legal status prevented him from going to court because he was hiding from the U.S. authorities.  PIVX is a compensation protocol originally invented by the creators of the DASH coin. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the coin will introduce the Zk-SNARKs confidentiality protocol of Zcash (ZEC).  On the other hand, Makafi is planning to launch his Ghost next month. His whitepaper also mentions zk-SNARKs – perhaps also a PIVX loan."

3141629,"  Researchers have found that BTC's ransom attacks are more common than previously thought. The British police received more than 560 reports of blackmail in 2018 and 2019.  Official figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the British police received 562 reports in 2018 and 2019 from victims whose devices were attacked by hackers who demanded a Bitcoin ransom. Northern Yorkshire police received the largest number of reports of such crimes. In 2018, there were only six such cases, and in 2019, the number rose sharply to 115.  The study describes the types of attacks. In one particular case in Kambria, the perpetrator accessed the victim's server and encrypted all the files during the attack. The victim was requested to pay the BTC within 72 hours, after which the amount would increase.  Other forms of blackmail were also accompanied by threats to increase the ransom. For example, the perpetrators told the victim in Derbyshire that if she did not pay the ransom, the hacker would publish publicly the history of the victims &apos; visits to the porn sites.  In one of the incidents investigated by the police in Darham, the hacker used social media to demand a ransom. The perpetrator sent a message to the victim via Facebook, which contained a link for the transfer of the BTC to his account. In Manchester, there were 83 cases of ransom demand in the bitcoins. In six cases, letters were sent to the victims with the intention of causing extreme emotional distress.  Hackers who demanded a batcoin ransom used the same tactics in almost all cases — blackmail and fear, designed not only to cause economic but also moral damage. They used threats, intimidation and other pressure tactics to achieve their goal. The Director-General of Retail Financial Consulting, Andrew Martin, noted:  "

It's worth 105 rubles, bought in the heartaches of choice between Agatha's grandmother and them. The choice was for a more attractive design. I'm afraid of the money, and I'm afraid of Agatha in particular. I think in order to buy the makeup of this brand, you have to be a math teacher and wear a beam and a blues. But not about that.

BlockFi, which has expanded to a number of new institutional and retail businesses, including the new major brokering business, is rapidly raising money. The firm that announced a $350 million D series in March was in the process of attracting an additional $500 million with a preliminary estimate of $4.75 billion.  With regard to the supply of the main interest account, BlockFi had to lower rates in recent months, citing changing market conditions.

3141645,"The Striming Block Platform Theta announced the launch of an updated version of Theta 2.0, as well as collaboration with Google. Google Cloud will become one of the corporate validators.  In addition to Google, corporate valifiers who will confirm transactions on Theta network include the Binance Krypto Exchange, the Japanese firm Gumi Cryptos, and the Blackchain Ventures venture fund. The platform's management noted that Google is the preferred provider of cloud computing, as once Theta 2.0 is launched, users will be able to run the nodes directly from the Google Cloud platform.  The developer of Google Cloud, Allen Day, noted that the block house would allow the application of new commercial models that would modernize the international digital economy, including the media and entertainment industry. The co-founder and CEO of Theta Labs Mitch Liu said that interaction with Google Cloud in several strategic areas would accelerate the development of Theta and facilitate the use of the platform in various industries.  To date, Theta has been used to broadcast cyber-sporting competitions, poker tournaments and major cryptoval conferences. In addition, a few weeks before the launch of the updated version of the network, the platform announced cooperation with the South Korean Samsung Corporation to launch its application on Android smartphones.  Blockchen is actively used by stripping platforms to obtain currents for broadcasting or viewing. For example, last month the Refereum platform reported a partnership with Tron that would enable gamers and viewers to receive TRX and BTT currents, and in March last year BitTorrent opened early access to the BitTorrent Live striming service."

That's why I know it's like I don't feel like it, and at the end of the day, I've also been eating, you know, hello.  The news of yesterday is several: 1. MAC PRO opened on a hot boulevard. It's a wildly large range, and it's like the first feeling of a portal where wages go. The store is right next to the huge H&M, which is also quite a portal. I think it's a worldwide conspiracy. It's all over Tversky. I was at the opening, but there were too many people there, so I'll go when it's quieter.  2.

3141647,"  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided on the Blockchain of Things (BCOT) blockage, which sold unregistered securities through the primary coin offer (ICO) in 2017.  The U.S. regulator, after studying the case, decided that the BCOT launch should cease all actions that violate the federal Securities Act and pay a fine of $250,000.  According to SEC, the company attracted about $13 million. As a result of the ICO, the aim is to develop a blocking platform that would allow developers to create apps for sending messages and creating digital assets.  Also, according to the SEC decision, the BCOT startup should return the funds to investors who acquired currents within ICO. BCOT is also required to register these currents as securities under the Securities Act of 1934 and to report regularly to SEC."

The Riot Blockchain showed the largest growth, increasing from $2.08 billion to $3.4 billion over that period, which was 63 per cent. Marathon grew by 55 percent.  According to reports in March, the Bitcoin mining companies have become more unstable than the Bitcoin itself. For example, Riot Blockchain moved from a company worth less than $200 million in 2020 to a maximum of $6.12 billion in February 2021.  Since February, Bitcoin mining companies have remained at a high level for the next few months before falling significantly in late April and early May. This trend began to change at the end of May, when companies recovered some of the lost items.  Despite lower ratings, the bitcoin mining companies still outnumber the bitcoin in the past year. Although the price of bitcoin rose by 334% during this period, the stock prices of four companies, Marathon, Riot Blockchain, Hive, and Canaan, rose even higher."

I've probably told you a million times, but in the last year and a half, my skin has always been wonderful without a single inflammation, so I want to cry and give it to someone else. Seriously, for a person who, even in adolescence, thought that a pimple was some kind of parallel universe, and two or three black dots a year were created for entertainment to press them, every inflammation/scratching/change of face becomes a huge personal tragedy.  It all started with the same year-and-a-half ago, the skin became awfully fat. It's just disgustingly fat. So fat that you wake up and you can fry an omelet on your forehead without getting out of bed, because he's already warmed up to his condition. Like any person who thinks he knows what to do with it (no), I actively dried my skin with clay masks, alcohol, and hell with Korean cleaning agents. Inflammation and pimples, where they weren't expected, came about six months ago. They're not very visible to the outside eye, but I'm just being thrown into the eyes of any mirror that's around. What did I do? That's right, I've dried it with clay.  In September, the fat season didn't go off my face, and I went to the cosmetics for the first time (I told you about Jul before, and I went to her).  I'm starting to go to doctors now, and I'm reviewing my food system, and I'm using acid. And I'm going to buy a billion towels, of course.   So what I'm saying in this post is that if you have problems that you didn't have before, it's no reason to experiment on yourself, it's an excuse to go to a specialist and find out in time what went wrong. It's about any problem, by the way. In my head, too.   I'll tell you about my acids. They're not gonna be very budget."

The ""User Verification Program"" will be launched on August 28 and will affect all clients of the trading platform. Verification will be required within the next six months. According to the company, this will allow it ""to create a more reliable and secure trading environment for all BitMEX users.""  Individual account holders will need to upload a photo of identity and address documents, selfies, and answer a few questions about the source of funds and trading experience. For corporate accounts, the verification procedure will not change.  Explaining the reasons for the decision, BitMEX writes: “Cryptocurrencies have come a long way in their 10 years of existence. Verification of the identity of users is becoming more common today, as it is necessary to comply with evolving international regulatory standards and is an essential element for building trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The actual security of customers is greatly enhanced by identity verification and will allow BitMEX employees to reliably verify the real account owner in the event of a dispute, hack or disability. ""  The lack of mandatory verification requirements along with high margin trading was one of the main features that attracted users to the BitMEX offer. The company was harassed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) last year for allegedly serving American traders on its platform."

I've had a eyebrow tusk for 319 rubles of magnet (from 300 to 450 on the Internet), but I didn't go in the first time, because I put it on my eyebrow markers, looked in the mirror, walked away in the ahua, seeing a dog with eyebrows from a picture. So the mascara was unfairly removed from the Narnia to the tweezers.  I don't know how she was taken out of there and put on her eyebrows without anything, and I'm selling it to the orders of a cosmetic god who didn't want me and you without cheap stinks, but now it's my favorite eyebrow remedy, here. The most important thing is to draw the right outline, and it's very soft and natural, like your desire to stay home and not go anywhere in the morning. We're gonna take the skin, if we're sure.  The eyebrows are luxurious, Armenian, recorded."

3141698,"Known in the crypto-community trader and analyst Tone Weiss predicted the disappearance of Tether USD's most popular stylcoin. He spoke about this in a panel discussion with the former head of the Bitcoin Foundation, Bruce Fenton, at the Baltic Honeybadger 2018 conference in Riga.  ""I don't understand why everyone's so attached to the stylcoins. After all, it's the same dollar that can be transferred through a technologically unstable centralized database, regardless of whether it's Ethereum, Omni Layer or Binance server. I believe that Tether will inevitably cease to exist in the future,"" Weiss stressed.  He added that Tether was a very acute problem for the cryptocular community, but few wanted to discuss it openly. In his view, it was the success of USDT that led to the launch of new stylcoins [in particular from Circle, Gemini and Pax].  ""If Tether falls, the exchanges will be badly hurt and likely to be forced to shift some of the losses to users, so they lose everything,"" noted the trader.  He also believes that the issue of providing USDT is a kind of double-edged sword. If the stylcoin is fully provided with dollars, the US government may at any time seize it under the pretext of illegal financial activity.  If not, Tether's holders will sell it massively at any price (below $1), which will create a substantial flow of funds into the Bitcoin.  In summary, Weiss, Tether threatens regulators and technological problems (bug or attack on Omni Layer).  In response to a question about Bitcoin-ETF approval, the trader suggested that SEC would still make a positive decision within two years. Nevertheless, it is difficult to predict the effect that this will have on the price of the first cryptation.  ""Remember what happened last November and December. Bitcoin's price has risen from $10,000 to $20,000 just on speculative expectations of the bitcoin futures and the involvement of the big Wall Street players. So what? After the launch, there was no volume, the market was dead. Nothing! That's why the price went down because it shouldn't have reached such high levels so fast. I think the same thing could happen to Bitcoin-ETF,"" he expressed his opinion.  He cited the launch of gold-based stock exchanges as an example.  ""Yes, then the price of gold rose sharply. What do we see now? Seven-year-old bear market from absolute maximums. I wouldn't call it manipulation, it's just nobody cares. These are excessive expectations,"" he said."

3141701,"The main VeChain network was officially launched, a block project aimed at creating and managing data on products and goods along supply chains.  The VeChain platform was launched in 2016 to create and manage data on products and goods along supply chains, and makes the process more transparent, addressing many of the existing problems in the sector. The VeChain application was still in the test stage involving several famous companies and brands working in logistics, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, Lux products, fashion industries, and wine and alcohol producers.  The VeChain platform assigns a unique identifier to the product, which is stored simultaneously in the locker and placed on the product with a NFC chip, a RFID tag or a QR code. Through these devices, VeChain can manage supply chains and track goods at any stage of its life cycle, solving the problem of counterfeiting.  Initially based in China, the company now operates from Singapore, with several offices in Europe.  The VeChainThor block is based on the consensus algorithm Proof-of-Authority (PoA). According to VeChain Foundation, the VeChainThor block is composed of 101 nodes owned by various organizations and individuals that have been tested for compliance with KYC policies and hardware and security standards.  Token VeChain (VEN), which at the test stage of the project existed as an ERC-20 current, is now acquiring its own life, and a number of large exchanges, including Binance, Bithumb and KuCoin, have already expressed support for its migration. Token migration itself is expected to last for several weeks."

3141703,"""We need to talk seriously."" Mood.  The street was seized by a poop, and I wanted to iron dogs and lie on the couch with pizza.  But who doesn't, let's talk about lush. Kmk, the product brief isn't very fair to such a good brand, so I'm gonna roll you a little bit. Today's theme is troublesome skin. Pimples, we're picking you!   My contact with Lush started five years ago with the Megamat mask, the giant pelvis with which was standing in the bathroom of a former boyfriend. If I've taken anything normal out of this relationship, it's a Megamate mask. The baby treats, drys, straightens up. Be careful, though, if the achilles heel is sensitive, the mask is nuclear, the face is drawn to God. Think, before you put it on your face every day, without skin, you won't get married.   A fresh Amazon mask. Called to fight pimples and other causes of failure in your personal life. It takes a long time to get used to her clay garlic smell and pieces of garlic inside. But you're used to your boyfriend. When used regularly (each day), the skin does become smoother and smoother.   Fresh mint chocolate mask for teenage skin from fat glitter and pimples. There's no need for words, a cheap and silent recommendation. If you're an 8th grader like me, Vadick, you're a fucking loser. You can use it every day, like a face after a spa. (I wasn't there, but I think it feels the same.)  Tea tree face tonic. It calms and purifies. Too bad it's just the skin, not the nervous system. It's a good thing with an earthen smell, and I'm doing it after I wash, and I believe in a miracle.   Coal black soap. I don't want to write anything, I didn't get in at all, even though I tried it repeatedly. It's gonna be rough, and then the skin's fat and red.   Oatmeal soap. Norm, but it's not gonna happen. It's soft, it's not dry.   That's what I use all the time. The cleaning line of the brand is much wider and asks itself to try. I love lush, alibiderci!"

3141711," The U.S. stock market is cryptic of Coinbase, recording a sharp increase of $1,200 in deposits. This week, the U.S. authorities also began sending out checks to citizens on which they are entitled.  CO Coinbase Brian Armstrong shared the statistics on his Twitter, but he refused to comment.  According to the submitted schedule, deposits of $1,200 usually account for about 0.08 per cent of the platform's total revenue. This week &apos; s deviation of up to 0.375 per cent is statistically significant in order to reasonably link it to the latest American government support measures.  There are 80 million adults in the United States who earn less than $75,000 a year. According to Finance Minister Stephen Mnuchin, they were to receive direct transfers to their bank accounts by 15 April.  Netspend, which processed about $1 billion in aid benefits, stated that they were mostly spent on ""food, fast food, medicine and gasoline"". Some of the funds are cashed into ATMs.  Members of the crypto community, including Guy Bennett, BitcoinorBust and El Barto, admitted that they had actually invested the money they had received in Bitcoin. At the current rate, $1,200 can be purchased for about 0.17 BTCs.  The co-founder of the BlackWorks Group, Jason Janowitz, reported that his friend had bought Bitcoin for the first time for money from the state. ""At first, the Fed is running a marketing campaign for bitcoin, and now it's financing its purchase less than a month before the Halwing,"" he wrote."

3141714,"In the next issue of their mailing, analysts from Coin Metrics responded to the question that had taken part in the cryptoval community in recent days: What is the real issue of Ethereum?  This is a topic of long concern to the community, and it was raised again by MacerDAO's developer Mark-Andre Dum's last week. He noted that he had received different values because of the bug in the Ethereum emission calculation script, but was subsequently able to produce a number as close as possible to the Etherscan data.  However, different sources continue to transmit different values. The root of the problem is that Ethereum, unlike bitcoin, does not have a simple command that produces current emissions cryptically.  ""Ethereum cannot determine the overall offer of their asset,"" wrote Morgan Creek Digital's partner and Bitcoin's supporter Anthony Pompiano. - It's a big problem that shows why ETH can't be a good form of money.""  According to Coin Metrics, which accounts for many detailed studies of the economy, as of August 9, the total number of ETHs released was 112.1146 million."

3141717,"The fourth largest bank in South Korea, Woori Bank, will establish a joint venture to provide storage services.  The Woori Financial Group, South Korea's fourth largest total asset creditor, has joined a growing list of institutions that have ventured to store cryptically.  According to a July 11 report by the Woori Financial Group, a large banking group entered into a partnership with a local company to develop a Coinplug blockage for the establishment of a joint venture called D-Custody. A joint venture may be established this month.  Turning to cryptics, Woori Bank wants to take advantage of the growing demand for storage solutions that are cryptizing among large South Korean companies that have access to a growing class of assets.  Since domestic firms are not allowed to store their cryptography on exchanges, they are forced to resort to self-reliance at their own risk. Thus, almost all banks in South Korea (including Samsung Bank) welcome the owners.  Last year, the Government legalized the cryptification and storage. Since then, Parliament has adopted a number of amendments that have led to the restructuring of the country &apos; s blockade industry. Now cryptofunds and kryptoskeletons are required to provide financial statements and must use only bank accounts with real names.   The strong regulatory climate has not weakened the enthusiasm of crypto-professionals. Exchange investors note an increase in digital currency activity."

3141781,"Adam Trademan, Director General of SBI Ripple Asia, will replace Yoshitaku Kitao, Director General of SBI Holdings, as a member of the Ripple Board of Directors.  Yoshitaka Kitao, known as one of Ripple's biggest supporters in Asia and CEO of the Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings, is likely to cease to be a member of the board of directors. Kitao is considered a key figure in numerous Ripple and XRP projects in Japan, such as MoneyTap and SBI Asia.  However, the replacement of Kitao and thus the new member of the Ripple Labs board of directors, Adam Trademan, is equally committed to the promotion of XRP in Asia. Trademan is the CEO of SBI Ripple Asia, SBI Mining Chip, as well as the CEO and co-founder of the BRD, the Ripple partner company, which provides financial services based on lockdown technology for the mobile generation. It is important to note, however, that the announcement has so far been official only indirectly, via the Ripple website.  Trademan should be a worthy substitute for Kitao. As CEO of SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between Ripple and SBI Holdings, he represents Kitao's mission to create the Internet of Values in Japan and other Asian regions. SBI Ripple Asia provides the RippleNet to financial institutions and remittance service providers in Japan, South Korea and other South-East Asian countries. In December 2019, the joint venture announced that it was seeking to capture up to 50 per cent of the transactions of the entire Ripple network."

However, yesterday, the founder of the crypto-exchange, Ivan Petukhovsky announced the cancellation of the previously planned ICO.  According to the data provided to them, the EXMO trading platform will open new services using its own resources. At the moment, crypto-currencies are under increasing control from state regulators. Therefore, conducting an ICO can result in unpredictable difficulties that can affect both the company itself and its numerous clients.  After the addition of margin lending, traders will be able to carry out operations to purchase crypto-loans using the leverage - borrowed funds from the very crypto-exchange. This will allow professionals to conduct more profitable trade transactions and, accordingly, to receive more profit."

3141804,"  Coinbase Justice and Bison Trails joined the Proof of Stack Alliance (POSA) Alliance, calling on regulators to develop regulations that clearly regulate steaking and its taxation.  The organization, which was founded in 2019, has more than 18 members. POSA discusses issues related to block-chamber regulation and critiques, organizes events and training seminars, and advocates a more loyal approach to steaking regulation. Coinbase Justice and Bison Trails will work with the alliance to promote its regulatory change initiative.  The Managing Director of Polychain Capital and a member of the Board of Directors of POSA, Matt Perona, explained that the main purpose of the Alliance was to change the taxation of steaking fees. In his view, only profits from the sale of currents received as remuneration should be taxed, not the receipt of such remuneration itself.   The Alliance leader clarified that the initiative was aimed at creating a regulatory framework conducive to steaking development. POSA will work directly with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US Financial Crime Network (FinCEN) and the U.S. Revenue Service (ISS) on issues related to the regulation of digital assets and securities.  Perona added that COINBASE CITY and Bison Trails would conduct training workshops for regulators on the topics ""What is steaking and blockches"", as well as on potential applications. Perona expressed the hope that by explaining the operating principles of technology to regulators, it would be possible to ""instill a love for the blocker"" and mitigate their harsh demands."

3141809,"The American company Digital Asset Investment Management (DAIM), which specializes in investment consulting services in the cryptate industry, announced the launch of its first-ever Bitcoin-supported pension plans.  DAIM will act as a consultant and trustee for companies wishing to offer employees a pension plan with the possibility of investing up to 10 per cent in Bitcoin along with traditional assets. The plan is based on model 401 (k), which is the most popular in the U.S. private pension system.  The task of storing DAIM's cryptomatic assets will be taken over by the Regulated Trust Unit of the Gemini Exchange.  ""We have seen a huge demand from individuals who want to invest in Bitcoin in 401 (k) since they received a permit in California in June 2018,"" said to companies, adding that traditional pension plan owners are losing money because of inflation.  Clients will be able to place a larger share of Bitcoin after consultation with DAIM. If employers wish, they can move employees from existing plans to a plan with access to bitcoin. If they want their staff to be moved to a new plan in 2021, an application must be filed by mid-December.  ""We believe that Bitcoin has proved its relevance in today's portfolio. Individuals should be able to lose track and invest directly through pension accounts,"" added to companies."

3141811,"The intruders have found a new way to add purses to the stock markets to cry out USDT's brand-fake currents. SlowMist, a security firm in the block-chamber industry, is writing about this.  According to analysts, hackers use Omni's protocol to produce USDT ""other type"" currents and transfer them to stockbags. If the stock exchange does not use a mechanism to verify the properties of the current, such a deposit may be accepted by its system as real.  SlowMist claims that in recent years they have been able to detect several similar attacks, which have resulted in losses to the stock exchanges. ""In view of the widespread distribution of USDT on the Omni protocol, many people think that there is only one version of such a current, and ignore other types of unknown currencies that can easily cause the problem of false replenishment,"" says the publication.  The amount of damage or the names of the affected exchanges are not specified by the analysts. They emphasize that a similar problem, exploited by another method, was known as early as July 2018.  Also this week, an updated implementation of Omni Core was introduced, in which developers solved another serious problem: ""In an earlier version of Omni Core, a problem affecting consensus was discovered. It could lead to double execution of certain transactions.""  ==History==The Bug appeared with the updating of Omni Core 0.6 in 2019. Because of it, the system could double-calibrate or remove the currents from the user, thus distorting his actual account balance. The team was able to locate seven blocks in which transactions could be performed more than once. After the first launch of Omni Core 0.80, the user account shall return to normal condition."

3141825,"The co-founder of the Gemini Exchange, Cameron Winklvoss, believes that the rise in the cost of the Dogecoin (DOGE) alcoin was due to increased protest activity in the trading market.  He spoke on Twitter and noted that people were tired of the monopoly of traditional money. They are now looking for the best investment option that will be as independent as possible from State institutions.  Winklvoss called on investors not to stop them from choosing where to invest their savings.  The co-founder's tweet Gemini was published after the DoGE coin had made a historic breakthrough.  The first day of February, Kryptova met at $0.044. The capitalization of altcoin now exceeds $5.617 billion. In mid-January, Dogecoin traded in an area of $0.007, and there was no signal of a rapid and dramatic change in the trend.  Since January 28, the coin has gone up 1152%. The community has made a major contribution to the DoGE's Twitter program called WallStreetBets. And some observers believe that this account has decided to push Dogecoin to $1.

3141857," .............................................. 📊 All the hopes of traders to raise the market due to the main crypto event of the year - the conference Consensus 2018, crashed against the harsh reality. Instead of conquering new peaks, bitcoin decided not to rush. As a result, during the past week, the main cryptocurrency lost 3% of the value and again returned to the level of $ 8,300. It is still difficult to make any forecasts. The information background clearly plays a downgrade - bitcoin is undergoing a massive attack of criticism from world-renowned businessmen: Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jack Ma, the founder and CEO of Alibaba, and others.  📈 Ethereum and the closing TRON ten do not seem to notice a general decline in the market - their losses for the week did not exceed 1.5%. However, their schedule also repeats bitcoin movements - if the BTC goes further down, they will follow it.  🤕Louzer among the top 10 in the past week was Bitcoin Cash -16.8% / $ 1,223. The BCH network, which increased the block size from 8MB to 32MB, did not meet with approval among the crypto community. Many users frankly do not understand what the block was enlarged for, even if during peak usage it did not fill more than 4.5mb.  ❌ One of the main news of the week was the adoption by the EU Council of more stringent rules on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Now, all clients of the crypto-exchange from the EU are required to undergo full identification.  👍🏻 Very positive news came from Florida - the state was the first in America, where they were allowed to pay taxes with cryptocurrency. If something is approved, then in another place should be banned. This is how the search engine Bing, owned by Microsoft, which banned advertising Crypto-currency.  🏆 And, of course, everyone was surprised by the Chinese, who issued their rating of the Crypto-currency.

3141867,"  The Brazilian congressman Aureo Ribeiro (Aureo Ribeiro), who had created a draft law on the regulation of the cryptoval market, had asked the local authorities to investigate cases of cryptocular fraud.  Ribeiro believes that the lack of adequate regulation, combined with high levels of anonymity, as well as a large number of international transactions and heightened interest in cryptivates, contributes to the spread of fraud.   The Congressman proposes to conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of cryptoval companies such as Zero10, Trade Group and Atlas Quantum.   ""Despite the fact that Atlas Quantum is the largest cryptoval company in Brazil, it has so far had legal and financial difficulties, so it must be closely monitored,"" Ribeiro said.  Last month, Atlas Quantum released a video confirming that $54 million in crypts were held in three HitBTC accounts. The Exchange denied the statement by calling the video a fake and notified investors of the absence of any funds belonging to Atlas Quantum.  Atlas Quantum submitted an audit report confirming the necessary amount in bitcoins and steaks, but investors still doubt whether the company will be able to meet its obligations when requesting large amounts of withdrawal.   It is reported that 234 congressmen have already signed the request for an investigation. This number of signatures is sufficient for the approval of the investigation.   This month, the United States Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Circle Society, which is charged with extortion and deception of investors, and in July, the Texas court ordered the organizers of the fraudulent scheme to pay a fine of $360,000."

3141882,"Today, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will appear before the Senate Committee, where he will speak about the fact that many large cryptographic exchanges must be registered as securities exchanges.  In an introductory statement published by the Senate Banking Committee, Hansler observed:  "
3141883,"Today, the Bitfinex cryptobar launched two new BIT (BIT mode) and SAT (SAT mode) modes.  Satoshi is the smallest unit on which bitcoin can be divided, and it corresponds to one hundred million bits of BTC. So 1 BTC = 100000000 SAT. Its name dates back to the alleged creater of the protocol of Batcoin Satoshi Nakomoto.  By activation of the SAT mode on the Bitfinex, you can use satos as a unit of measurement (SAT) instead of bitcoin (BTC), which will simplify the task for those who use small amounts because one BTC is now equivalent to $42,500.  In addition to the SAT regime, the exchange also activated BIT (microbitcoin), with one BIT equivalent to one million bitcoin or 100 satosha. So 1 BTC = 1000000 BIT.  When the BIT mode is activated, one million bitcoin will be used as a unit of measurement instead of BTC, which currently varies about $0.04.  In order to turn on the SAT or BIT mode, users need to go into the settings of their account in the interface section where they will find the model parameters: BTC, which means bitcoin, SAT (1/100 M BTC), which means satosh, and BIT (1/1M BTC), which means microbitcoin.  "

3141888,"Miners' demand for mining equipment is cryptified first caused a lack of video cards on the market, and now it's moved to the storage segment. According to HKEPC, Hong Kong's technology publication, miners buy HDD and SSD for production cryptate on Chia, although it is not even available for trading at the moment.  Excess demand has led to a shortage of savings from large sellers in Asia, as reflected in their prices. The SSD has the greatest interest. So, due to the demand of the engineers, SSD prices ranged from $4 to 16 terabytes, rising from $25 to $75.   The Chinese manufacturer SSD Jiahe Jinwei informed MyDrivers that all high-product SSDs of the NVMe M.2 standard were sold on 1 and 2 TB. In this connection, the company decided to follow the example of Nvidia and will try to limit the sale of minners, as well as to increase production and produce a specialized model for the production of crypthalate. It is expected that such devices will be delivered directly to the miners by bypassing the shelves of shops.  Chia Network is being developed by BitTorrent Bram Cohen. He promises to solve the problem of the high energy consumption of the bitcoin networks, Etherum, Litecoin and others cry at the Proof of Work algorithm through their own consensus mechanism, Proof of Space and Time. To do this, the network uses the free space on the discs of the laptop, sending them the random value they have to find in memory to get the right to add the next block.  The important advantage of Chia Network is the use of time parameters other than space. Chia's production involves a large volume of reading and recording operations, which protects itself from the attacks of the mainstream miners. However, the distribution of the probabilities of adding blocks continues to be based on the proportional share of each engineer in the total free storage space.  The Chia network is currently supported by 30,000 hard drives with a total volume of 260 petabytes (260,000 terabytes). The resource increase is about 500 HDDs per day."

3141890,"The last adjustment on Saturday, July 17, was still worth ~ 5% for the fourth consecutive time. The previous adjustment resulted in the largest drop in percentage terms, 28 per cent two weeks ago. With the last fall, the complexity of the Bitcoin has reached a new minimum since January 2020.  This fall was due to the fact that many Chinese engineers have left the Bitcoin network in the last few weeks. The smaller number of people mining BTC units means that fewer units will be added to the BTC block chain. According to the data, the current time interval is 10 minutes.  Interestingly, reducing the complexity of engineering also means that the Bitcoin engineers who stay online will have much more money. Speaking to CNBC during the last difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arwanaga reported to the publication.  "

The Tezos protocol will be used as the basic infrastructure for the issuance, transfer, and storage of digital assets, which will then be available on the secondary market of PRO Securities, a tZERO registered SEC unit.

In response to a question about how much he believed in Bitcoin, Draper said, ""A lot, a lot, a lot. I just believe and say he's better. In the long run, people turn to things that are better. I think that's the safe asset right now.""  A comment on Bitcoin Draper was made at the same time as stock markets were declining. On Monday, at the opening of the tender, the Dow Jones index collapsed by more than 800 points. The observed phenomenon of CNN links itself to concerns about the coronavirus. This is the third largest reduction in the 124-year history of the tool.  The investor admitted that by that time his stock markets had already been severely restricted, as he had previously observed ""unbridled"" stock movements. ""They just overreacted – the market got excited, and Uber drivers switched to day-to-day trading. There were all the signs,"" he explained.  Draper also confirmed his prognosis on the Bitcoin rate of $250,000. He now expects this to happen in 2022 or early 2023. ""It's a big movement about where it is now. I think Bitcoin will become a preferred currency,"" Draper said.  He also referred to Warren Buffett's comment on the zero value of bitcoin. ""He sees a huge threat to his savings. Its savings are more than 50% in banks and insurance companies at Berkshire Hathaway. Of course he doesn't need a new currency.

But how annoying it is when a cool, comfortable service/magazine is served by a completely insane delivery service.  Seriously, how many times have I been sitting at home all day because of a courier who can't tell you the approximate time of arrival, and at the end of the day turns out he didn't make it, how many times have he been brought in at the wrong place or at the wrong time? I'm pretty sure we're gonna get exactly $30,000 here with similar stories.  Why, all of a sudden, a bugurt like that, would you ask? And then I'm gonna say that another bottom was broken recently after the girl's order (no claims against them - they're honestly trying to do something very quickly) when the delivery of the week is in the hands of a delivery partner - the contact one outside the house, but they can't give it back because they can't see it, they don't have a consignment note, they don't have a lot of work to do, come on! (ALYO, do you even know that the '90s bar closed and now you have to be client-oriented?) And if I've been thinking of the paperwork situation from Prostvashino as a little hyperbolic, it's not -- it's been paid and it's been under the counter for a week now, but we don't have the paperwork and we don't have the foot! And the name of such situations is Legion!  Despite the love of ASOS and the beautifully accessible clothes from there, I'm not gonna order anything again, because their delivery partner is Pony Express, who regularly fucks bags, brings them in ""unfortunately dropped off the train on full speed, had to kick to Moscow, so in this condition for so long, here.""  I mean, you know what's funny, right? - the deliveryer is picking up, and in the end, you don't want to use the service directly (ASOS, Girlfriend, OZON, Labyrinth, etc.). In fact, to the great horror, I realized that the only delivery I've ever had was a happy and uneasy delivery to the MIF publisher without joking. And I'd really like the shops to finally realize that the pleasure of shopping online and logistics is very much tied up, and there's no discount in which we agree to take a spit on a client!  I love to do Internet shopping, honestly, because it's like getting a gift from Santa Moroz, only in the version of ""You're almost 30, you have to pay for your apartment and remember to buy toilet paper,"" and that's the feeling when you're sitting, waiting, and you kind of know what's in there, because you wrote a letter, but it's still interesting that Santa Christmas is gonna put the snow marks daddy made around the tree-- nervous piercing and anticipation-- oh, I think I'm even waiting for food to be delivered. But all this magic turns into hell when you're told that you're expecting a courier from 8:00 a.m. until the second arrival, that 10 out of 11 names are not available, so we've processed 1, so delivery is paid and so on.  Anyway, if you have something similar (and I'm sure you do), write to us urgently on lazy mail. "

Currently, 13 crypthalates are subject to Bappebti regulatory supervision and the tax will be automatically applied by these platforms if approved, according to Phnom Penh Post.  ""They are currently undergoing internal testing at Bappebti, then we will coordinate with BKF,"" said Sidharth Utama, head of Bappebti, adding that the actual tax rate has not yet been determined. BKF is a member of the Indonesian Fiscal Policy Agency.  Regulatory activity in Indonesia has increased dramatically over the past six months, as the Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider market have crept to new record maximums. In December 2020, Bappebti issued a decree recognizing 229 original crypts as legally traded goods, leaving traders the opportunity to offer to add new coins to the list. In February, the agency identified 13 trade sites recognized as licensed.  Initially, Indonesia warned against being used as a means of payment in 2014, and by 2017, it had passed a law requiring the Fintech companies to register with the Bank of Indonesia to ensure that they did not use cryptivates in payment systems.  The President of the Indonesian Association of Traders had cryptized Teguh Kurniavan said that the group he represented had proposed a tax rate of 0.05 per cent, adding that a high tax rate could push people into illegal channels when buying crypt.

Hardfork Ether has been in bad shape for a long time, but since the end of March the current has shown considerable growth. Let's talk more about it.  Ethereum Classic emerged as a result of the opposition of a part of the Ethereum community to the forced holding of the Dao. In 2016, there was a sad event that called into question the existence of the entire Etherium. After a successful attack on the network, Ethereum was upgraded to two parallel branches of cryptolation: Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum Classic (ETC).   ETC is an unrecognized part of Ether, supported by some members of the community. As we know, the main branch has gone far ahead, becoming the second cryptized branch in the world. The ETC lacked stars from the sky, but the last month's growth brought the current back to the TPW-20 crypts.  Ethereum Classic capitalization is $9,751,696,312, and 0.41%. The course at the time the article was published was $76.06. The token record is set today, at $80.45. The daily growth rate was 43 per cent, 126.7 per cent in the week, and 423.1 per cent in the month. In the year, ETC grew by 955 per cent (Etherum ETH, for example, added 1539 per cent in the year)."

The latter is about the history of the founding brothers of the stock exchange, which is cryptified by Gemini Cameron and Tyler Winklvoss.  ""I'll tell you one thing: I'll never refuse to be paid with Bitcoin again,"" Mesrich said.  ""Me too,"" wrote Mask in his comments.  This week, Mask was named the richest man on the planet. His condition was estimated to be $185 billion after another leap in the stock value of Tesla. The mask owns 20 per cent of the securities of its company, which capitalizes over $800 billion. In early 2020, his condition was estimated at $27 billion, barely enabling him to enter the top 50 richest people.  In recent times, Mask has been making contradictory comments about the first cryptoval. Thus, at the end of December, he stated that ""bitcoin is almost the same kind of galimatia as violin money"". In doing so, he remains faithful to his beloved cryptation. ""One word: Doge,"" he wrote at the time.  Users note that, contrary to Mask's own words, Tesla still does not accept Bitcoin payment. Some dealers, such as Lamborghini Newport Beach, are already adapting to the current bull market and announcing a reception.  ""Tesla Model X was bought yesterday, unable to pay for bitcoin,"" said an analyst, Scott Melker. In fact, the tax consequences of buying a car for bitcoin in the United States are a deterrent.

3141940,"In April, Bitcoin's revenues rose by 8% compared to the previous month, largely thanks to the recovery in the price of the cryptovalut, calling attention to The Block.  In April, the Mayners lost $412.5 million to the cryptoval, compared to $380.1 million in March. The calculations were based on the assumption that the engineers immediately sold the bitcoins after they were extracted.  Analyst Larry Churmack points out that most of the meiner's income has been awarded for adding blocks that are still 12.5 BTCs, but will be halved next week. The transaction processing fees paid by users were only 1.5 per cent of total Mayner income for April.  Cermak also states that the volume of sales by cryptating on the spot market fell by 25.2 per cent in April. The decline occurred for the first time in five months. Moreover, he was confident that the current growth was not driven by the interest of retail investors.  ""Here's FOMO retail investors,"" Cermak writes, pointing to the low number of new subscribers at the Coinbase and Binance exchanges on Twitter, which contrasts with the end of 2017. - I used Twitter subscriptions to illustrate it. The same is true for web-trading exchanges, Google requests, and so on."

3141942," Jake Chervinsky, the CEO of the Company Finance, expressed his personal opinion about the recent fall of Bitcoin and the SEC's fear of cryptoval ETF. ""Bitcoin fell 20% in a matter of hours and no one can give an objective reason. In doing so, off-shore unregulated marginal trading platforms have been well earned. Perhaps the elimination of such sites was the first cause of the fall. And then you're still wondering why SEC has doubts?"" he writes on his Twitter page.  The Exchange Investment Fund (ETF) allows the asset to be traded without ownership of the asset itself. ETF on bitcoin is a purely speculative tool that does not have any additional difficulties in buying and storing crypthalates. The endorsement of the ETF for Bitcoin will attract new investors who are already used to the infrastructure of traditional markets and do not want to use cryptocular exchanges for any reason.  Chervinsky notes that, to date, similar tools already available in traditional markets are not in high demand, as most of the bidding still takes place in offshore markets. In addition, according to the Legal Counsel, the trading platforms he mentioned profited from the volatility of the courses, which resulted in volume increases and liquidations. The owners of such sites are not interested in a calm market.  ""I have no specific evidence of manipulation. The problem that SEC is presenting is that it is not possible to prove whether the manipulations were real or not. In traditional markets, the situation is different because the regulator can rely on exchange standards and analyse trade data,"" Chervinsky says.   ""Some experts suggest that Bakkt's launch was already priced, and the collapse was based on the principle of buying rumors and selling on the news. Others note a sharp drop in hashrate. Others try to build graphics using technical analysis. How does this look in the eyes of SEC? Let's try to say to them, ""Don't worry. It's not manipulation, we can all explain the technical analysis.  Let's recall that this week's Bitcoin course dropped sharply below $8,000. Right now, the first crypto is trading around $8,100."

3141951,"  According to a study conducted by Eurokahedge, hedge funds using Bitcoin as their main asset were the most profitable in 2019.  On average, the profits of the hedging funds were more than 16 per cent, while traditional hedging strategies brought only 10.4 per cent of the profits to portfolio owners.  The difference is not so significant, but it is beneficial for the Bitcoin in the eyes of traditional investors. German Deutsche Bank stated in January 2020 that cryptivites looked more attractive than traditional assets and that more people would accept bitcoin because of its ""technology advantages"".  It should be noted that the process of acquiring and selling bitcoin is much easier and faster than traditional assets, and this allows hedge fund managers to respond quickly to all market changes.  The 2019 was the year of the rebirth of Bitcoin, as the cryptivate grew by 200 percent in the first two quarters. Success was achieved through the US-China trade war, the devaluation of the renminbi, and the announcement of the Libra project by Facebook.  In 2018, Bitcoin lost about 85% of its maximum of $20,000 on December 2017. Bitcoin's collapse occurred after many investors lost their money on startups allegedly using block-chamber technology, but in fact turned out to be fraudsters.  However, recent hedge fund income figures show that investors are regaining confidence in cryptized assets.  Steve Kurtz of the Galaxy Digital cryptographic foundation stated in one of his interviews that investors who wanted to buy bitcoin ""beginning,"" because their return estimates, which took into account the periods of one, three and ten years, ""was impressive"".  Founder B2C2 Max Boonen also believes that Bitcoin ""can join a league of larger traditional assets,"" such as stocks and bonds (although this article refers to the fact that bitcoin is beneficially different from such assets).  Meanwhile, Chris Zulke of Cumbland Chicago stated that in the near future ""traditional banks can take over the role of Bitcoin broker"".  Despite the growth of bitcoin, large investors still fear bitcoin as an asset that is ""unregulated"" and ""exposed to manipulation"".  "

MacerDAO controls the protocol by which users can release DAI algorithms on bail. In the past, it was provided exclusively by air, but a new version of DAI was launched in November 2019 with several types of security, including assets with a centralized structure.  These assets include, for example, the USDC Stabble, which is produced by American companies Coinbase and Circle, as well as the WBTC tecenized bitcoin, for which the BitGo caste company is responsible for producing and storing. The DAI also uses TUSD and Pax Standard (PAX), controlled by TrustToken and Pax. Four of these assets account for 39.27 per cent of the bond in the MacerDAO vaults.

It can be traded by accredited investors outside the United States.  ETF or the stock traded on the market, as the name suggests, is an index fund whose shares are traded on the exchange. The launch of Bitcoin-ETF in the United States is expected to significantly increase the availability of cryptivate investments for traditional market participants, but regulators have not approved any applications for such an instrument until then.  The new ETF will be available at the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), where fewer investors can work with it than in the US. However, the launch of the fund reflects the interest of firms specializing in stock exchange products in the area of traditional finance and the provision of data to them in creating cryptative proposals. The S&P Global and the Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE) have previously announced the preparation of their own indices, which could form the basis for similar instruments in the future.  The development of the Nasdaq cryptoval index began in July 2020. The Brazilian investment manager Hashdex also participated in the process. For the first time, the approval of ETF listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange was announced in September 2020.  Nasdaq reported that they wanted to present an index that reflected the most liquid and preferred cryptate assets for large institutions. It currently includes six digital assets: Bitcoin, Etherum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chanlink and Stillar Lumens.

Kioxia is one of the largest players in the NAND memory chip market, which provides a location for the storage of data on phones and hard drives, competing with South Korean Samsung and SK Hynix. Last year Hynix agreed to buy a $9 billion NAND business from an American manufacturer with an Intel Corp (INTC.O) chip.  Analysts say the Intel deal gives us an idea of how much buyers are willing to pay for memory companies. Summit Insights Group analyst Kinnghai Chan said that Kioxia's sales were about three times the value of Intel's memory module, so Kioxia's owners may want about three times the price of $25 billion to $28 billion."

In addition, they say that SEC not only distorts the legal issues in this case, but deliberately neglects the facts of paramount importance.  It will be recalled that SEC recently requested the court to issue an order enabling it to obtain from Telegram all the necessary documents concerning the receipt and expenditure of funds raised in connection with the ""unregistered sale of securities"". The Commission decided to act through the court because the company refused to provide the requested documentation.  The founder and CEO of Telegram, Pavel Durov, is due to testify on the case next week, and the judge will soon decide whether to grant or reject the SEC motion.

The launch of the derivatives market for BETH will provide access to liquidity for investors who cannot use the coins from the deposit contract until the first phase of the renewal.  However, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said that the deposit contract was specifically designed to prevent another type of ETH from becoming available for trading. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin doubts that anyone would want to provide liquidity for the second version of Ether, sent to staking, as moving ETH to Ethereum 2.0 without a validator status will not bring profit.  At the same time, Coin Metrics co-founder Jacob Franek (Jacob Franek) believes that this will not stop exchanges from listing such assets, performing the function of ""debt"" coins. Their price may depend not only on the reward for staking ethers in the Beacon Сhain. The cost can also be influenced by the risks associated with trading products based on the blockchain, which is still in development. For example, penalties for failing to validate a new chain can negatively impact deposits. In turn, this will affect BETH trading as well.  Hasu, an anonymous cryptocurrency researcher, believes intermediaries should be concerned about security first. People who take on financial risks will no longer just issue blocks, and block validators will only bear indirect financial risks. Hasu proposed to tie the BETHs available for trading to the amount of Ether allocated for staking on centralized exchanges."

After changing a number of products, these gentlemen came to their CA when they wanted to be cheaper, but to make their eyes happy. The clever Agatha gave me shampoo. She met me and handed him, ""Hey, hey, look at the volume of 129 rubles."" I looked at this bag, I looked at the price tag, and now we're standing by the register.  By the way, shampoo's good.

3142024,"The New York Times, a research division of the American daily The New York Times, is testing its own block project to reduce the dissemination of unreliable information online. In particular, these are images that can be edited after being uploaded to the network in order to distort their essence.  The Project News Origin tests are designed to determine the public's reaction to online images. To that end, a prototype was created using a block-chamber that allowed for the simulation of images in the news tape of the intended social network.  ""We wanted to know if visible contextual information, such as the name of the photographer or the location of the shoot, would help readers to better recognize the reliability of the photos in the news tape,"" explains the publication.  In this case, the blockchen helps track the history of the distribution of images from the source, making it an ""attractive technology for determining origin"". The initial results encouraged researchers as readers noted an improved understanding of the context of such an approach.  ""Though the blocker can be a viable tool for preserving the source of the news photos, there are a number of challenges that need to be adequately answered before it can be widely used,"" researchers say.  Thus, during the testing, the prototype of the social network automatically linked the image to the identifier in the locker. In reality, the system itself should be able to find such associations, but in the case of a modified image, it may be problematic. Moreover, such a system could not be effective without the massive involvement of news organizations, but the technical requirements for joining it were still too high."

The disadvantage of such systems is their high vulnerability because of their centralized nature. Etherum applications do not require the user to make their data available to the public.

3142047,"The Bill regulating the Bitcoin should be submitted to the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies in the next few days. It is believed that federal deputy Aureo Ribeiro, Brazilians will soon be able to buy houses, cars, and even McDonald's for Bitcoins after approval of his law, which will soon happen.  This was stated at the end of September, when a decision was taken to approve the bill. Thanks to the success of this phase, the next step in the Bitcoin approval chain is the consideration of the Chamber of Deputies during the plenary session.  As Aureo Ribeiro said, he is pleased with the approval of the ""Bitcoin Act"". The Congressman is confident that this is an important project for Brazil in the area of crypto-economics, which will be approved from the early stages of the bill.  He said that Brazilians faced the Bitcoins in many places with the opportunity to buy, sell and invest in the sector. However, Aureo stressed that the market was not regulated and therefore not legally recognized. He said that he was confident that, with the approval of his bill with an ""innovative"" text, several countries would copy Brazil's regulatory model.  On the question of what would change in the cryptivate law, the parliamentarian felt that the country was becoming a reference point for new foreign investment.  In addition, financial pyramids with cryptivates will be clearly regulated and their distribution across the country will be hampered.  Most recently, all kinds of financial frauds and schemes have been activated, based on the use of technology, and Bitcoin. Atlas Quantum and Bitcoin Banco Group, for example, caused multimillion-dollar damage to the population, and were a completely uncontrollable segment of the market. The bill initiated by Ribeiro should also take this direction into account.  According to Aureo Ribeiro, the bill regulating the crypthalates should be submitted to the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies within the next few days, i.e. Bitcoin could still be recognized by Brazil in 2021. He said that the law had the support of the Government and had already been agreed upon with Arthur Lear, President of the Chamber of Deputies (PP-AL), so there was no obstacle to its approval.  Thus, if Bitcoin becomes the official means of payment in Brazil, then it will further prove that the crypt is no less than, or even superior to, standard financial instruments."

In the latest version of Uniswap, liquidity suppliers are allowed to set certain price parameters within which they would like to add liquidity. If, for example, you think that the Ethereum price will continue to negotiate between $2450 and $2,700, as it was last week, you tend to add liquidity to this particular range.   This is because Uniswap pays liquidity suppliers part of the proceeds from all trade fees received. The most common trade commission is 0.3 per cent, but it can be changed."

3142082,"  A number of ASIC designers will be turned off after the bitcoin chalwing forever. The Poolin pool figured out what devices would go offline and how much the hashrate would fall from the first crypt.  The Vice-President of Poolin, Alejandro de la Torre, reviewed the lower quartile of the total bitcoin hashrate (from 0 to 25 T/s) and divided it into two teraches per second. This quartile contains most devices with 16- and 10-nanometre chips.  The most popular engineer for the last four years was Antminer S9 from Bitmain. All versions fall within the 12-22 T/s range and the standard model generates 13.5 T/s. They are responsible for almost all computing power between 12 and 14 T/s, which is 15 to 30 percent of the network hashrate, writing de la Torre.  The bullet calculated the electricity prices of the lower quartile miners that would remain profitable. The calculation took into account the bitcoin price of $7,000 and the current difficulty of mining.  The maximum tariff for the most powerful devices in the lower quartile is 3.4 cents per kilowatt. Devices between 0 and 10 T/s will be profitable only with free electricity and no other costs.  In the range of 10-16 T/s, at 3 cents per kilowatt, only Antminer S9K will survive. This range is 46% of the hashrate in the lower quartile. Most of the devices require a rate of not more than 2 cents per kilowatt. And even if they survive, they point out de la Torre, growing complexity will eventually force them to leave offline.  In the range of 16-26 T/s, the chances of surviving halwing and maintaining profitability are higher in the short term. The devices are at a rate of 3-3.5 cents per kilowatt.  Poolin expects less than 15% of hashrate left in the lower quartile after the chalwing. The situation for these devices may worsen the calculation of complexity in the run-up to the Halwing. The indicator is expected to rise.  De la Torre added that the new 5-nanometre devices would remain profitable for the next four years, as the industry had reached the limit of Moore's law.  Halving will be on #630,000. It should be produced on 12 May if the abnormal acceleration of production does not bring about adjustments."

Many girls conclude that it is easier to communicate with boys and that there is no woman's friendship at all.  But it's wrong! Support for women's society is an incredibly important and necessary thing! After all, by accepting experience, helping us to develop, by sharing advice, we are getting better together.  Stereotyping is not easy, but one can try to start with small steps. For example, more often compliment other girls, don't be afraid to ask for advice from girls who inspire you, try to make new acquaintances. Find interesting events in your city, because it's easier to find friends where people with certain interests gather, so you'll have something to talk about. Try to be more open if other girls ask you for advice or ask for help! And if you see a girl's interesting project on the Internet, don't be afraid to talk about it on your page or make a repost. At the end of the day, you're gonna be more open and you're gonna realize that supporting each other is amazing!"

In addition, node operators and miners are encouraged to update the software until 30 December, and the approximate launch dates can be tracked on Etherscan.  No action will be required from users who store ETH on cryptoval exchanges as well as on hardware, mobile and web wallets, otherwise instructions will be issued for them.  Hardfork Muir Glacier is designed to delay the activation of the ""complex bomb"" by another 4 million blocks (for about 611 days). After this period, it is likely that the problem will become irrelevant as a result of the transition to PoS, although this is not the first time that the bomb has been activated. The issue of changing or removing the ""complicity bomb"" had previously been discussed, but given the short time frame, the developers had decided to use the proven method of delaying activation.  Last week, Etherium developer Danny Ryan announced a safety audit of Ethereum 2.0 during phase zero, due to take place in February. This audit will test the vulnerability to DoS attacks as well as the abuse of resources, which may result in undesirable chains."

According to researchers Arcane Research on Twitter, the demand for bitcoin in Argentina has increased by 1,028 per cent since January 2018, with exponential growth. In addition, the volume of trade in Bitcoin with the United States dollar in Argentina increased by 139 per cent.  On Wednesday, Argentina was unable to pay another $500 million in interest on government bonds purchased by private investors, which triggered a 30-day withdrawal to pay off the debt.   If a country is unable to pay, it will result in a formal default. Against this background, private investors who fear default and currency inflation are trying to transform assets into other forms, including Bitcoin.  In order to stabilize the economy, the Argentine authorities could take measures that would lead to the deflation of the peso. Alex Machinsky, CEO of Celsius Network, spoke about this the other day when he said that ""if you buy bitcoin, you bet world currency deflation."""

3142126,"  Bitcoin's price has risen to a maximum of $9,400 this Thursday, but traders will remember for a long time the events of 12 to 13 March, when the market suffered a sharp collapse.  ""It was the most volatile day in Bitcoin's modern history,"" said the co-founder of Coin Metrics' analytical firm, Nick Carter, in a conversation with Bloomberg.  According to Coin Metrics, since then, the exchanges have lost their clients' deposits. The average daily trade volume of major derivatives, including Huobi, BitMEX and OKEx, fell by 30-60% from March to April, according to CryptoCompare. In spot markets such as Binance and OKEx, at least 10% of the stock fell.  ""We were greatly disturbed by the collapse. It's not very good for the stock market,"" reported the Vice-President of the Global Business Huobi Group, Siara San. When someone gets hurt and gets eliminated, we lose a lot of clients. It's bad for the entire ecosystem. Some clients need time after liquidation. Others will never return.""  After the collapse, Huobi recorded a sharp decline in the number of institutional clients holding between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoins. At the same time, the company noted the influx of small traders with less than 1 BTC in their accounts. The number of new registrations and active traders decreased in April compared to February and January.  ""In general, liquidity has fallen slightly,"" said Sam Bankman-Frid, co-founder of FTX. - Volatility has increased a little, because many people are now placing less on the market than they used to be.""  Some of the exchanges experienced interruptions, which were also observed during last night's rise. ""Even though no stock exchange exploded this time, it was a reminder that they were fragile in nature,"" Carter added.  ""We are changing a lot in our internal systems for the safety and prevention of similar situations,"" reported CEO Finance Changpen Jao. The main issue for us now is to increase the resources of the system.""  However, Binance noted a significant increase in new users relative to February values. ""Perhaps users from other exchanges are coming to us,"" Zhao suggested.  Now the exchanges are not ready to change their policies on marginal trade: the availability of a high shoulder is described as one of the factors behind the sharp collapse of the exchange rate. However, they have taken other measures. Huobi, for example, introduced emergency restrictions. They don't stop the bidding completely, but they avoid unnecessary liquidations when the course is over a certain limit. In addition, the exchange has launched a phase-out mechanism, which is expected to provide additional protection to traders."

Osprey is a company that ""creates decisions for investment in digital assets for intellectual investors"", adding a website. The firm claims that OBTC is its flagship product.  ""OBTC began to be listed in the over-the-counter market today, Friday, January 15. ====Greg King====The Director General of the Osprey Funds, Greg King. - As of January 14, this year, the product met all the requirements to be listed in the OBTC over-the-counter market. Within the next 30 days, the fund will confirm compliance with the requirements of the depositary trust company, and after 14 February, all market players will be able to quote it. This will mean that the fund is fully operational.""  The Grayscale Foundation became one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin, and as of November 2020 it owned more than 500,000 BTCs. The firm manages the GGTC Trust Fund, which is a way to acquire Bitcoin in the form of shares. Each GGTC stock represents a portion of Bitcoin (0.00094 BTC at the time of publication). Stakeholders buy and sell shares without restrictions, and they are accessible on major brokering platforms.  GGTC thus facilitates institutional players &apos; access to bitcoin by offering tools that are familiar to them that do not require the storage of their own funds. However, the Bitcoin Trust Grayscale requires an annual management fee of 2%. The competition, Osprey, announced a commission of only 0.49%. Apparently, the company wants to capture Grayscale's share of the market at the expense of a lower commission.  ""We are always happy to see products that provide digital access to the market, especially here in the United States,"" said Bloomberg Director General Grayscale Michael Sonnenstein."

3142182,"Investors' interest in the bitcoin options of the Chicago Commodity Exchange (CME) reached record levels in the days after the Halving, drawing attention to CoinDesk.  On Monday, when the win was reduced from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, CME reached $17 million, exceeding the previous maximum of $9.9 million recorded on 6 May. Since then, it has continued to grow.  On Tuesday, CME recorded a new $30 million record, updating it again the next day around $40 million. On Thursday, the volume was $36 million, an increase of 2,000 percent over $1.7 million last week.  Open interest in the CME Bitcoin options market has grown by more than 270 percent over the last week. The number also updated the record daily this week and on Thursday at the close of the bid was $142 million. Since the beginning of the month, growth has exceeded 1,000 per cent.  According to the CEO crypto-analytical platform Skew Emmanuel Goe, the growth in volume and active positions reflects the increased participation of institutional investors in cryptic trade. Such investors often use options as an instrument to hedge their own positions in spot or futures markets. For example, some firms with long positions took options to sell to protect themselves from the risks of a sudden market collapse against the background of the Halving.  In recent days, investors have also had reason to use hedging instruments as a result of increased market volatility. Bitcoin fell from $10,000 to $8,000 last weekend, but on Wednesday, he almost totally fell.  Although the activity on CME has increased this week, the exchange makes a small contribution to the overall volume of the Bitcoin options market. More than 70 per cent of the volume is still in the Panama's Deribit platform."

Note that Binance has taken similar steps earlier. For example, in April last year, during the transition from Ethereum to its own Binance Chain network, the exchange “burned” 5 million BNBs of the ERC20 standard.  The statement on the trading platform emphasizes that the liquidation of tokens in April 2020 was the largest in the history of Binance.  The administration also notes:  “Burning reflects activity on the margin, futures and spot markets of Binance, as well as among partners who used BNB from January to March. This is the largest BNB burning in both tokens and fiat. ”  Under the quarantine regime introduced in many countries because of the coronavirus pandemic, interest in cryptocurrencies has grown sharply. As a result, the traffic of crypto exchanges, including Binance, significantly increased.  At the end of March, Binance Coin jumped in price by almost 50%, the capitalization of this altcoin is now holding above $ 2.469 billion."

SBI manages the SBI VC Trade cryptobier, and according to the official Twitter account, anyone who opens the account from June 1 to September 30 will receive 50 XRP (currently equivalent to approximately $10).  SBI is one of Ripple's closest partners, and Japan uses the MoneyTap solution from Ripple in its own electronic payment platform. Earlier this month, the company announced its intention to introduce a solution that MoneyTap uses in hundreds of Japanese ATMs.  Her CEO, Yoshitaka Kitao, is a member of the Ripple Board of Directors, and the company made several payments to the XRP shareholders of its subsidiary, Morningstar.  SBI VC Trade also reports that it has launched an e-KYC authentication platform (Know-Your-Customer), which allows new clients to conduct the entire registration process using their smartphones.  This step comes from the hot tracks of another big new player on the Japanese crypto stage. For example, Rakuten's e-commerce giant began a month-long thematic event by Bitcoin Pizza Day. His subsidiary, Rakuten Delivery, offers Bitcoin (BTC) clients about $9 – provided they already have or open an account at Rakuten Wallet.  Japanese business experts argued that the new regulatory rules of the kryptorina, which came into force on 1 May, gave the industry more legitimacy – and encouraged the marketologists, especially the larger and richer players."

The same thing about gold and bitcoin is that the price of these assets depends entirely on the ratio of demand to supply. However, I'm sure the investor has an important difference between them: ""Good news about Bitcoin is his limited offer. The bad news about gold is that it will continue to be mined.""  Note, however, that the release of new BTC will not cease within the next 100 years. However, every four years, there will be a halving that halves the meiner's reward for the unit. The next promotion of the award is expected in May 2020.

Futures contracts are often traded with a prize in bull or neutral markets. This applies to any asset, not just cryptivates. However, an average annual bonus of 50 per cent for a contract that expires after three months is very rare.  Three-month futures are usually traded with a bonus of between 10% and 20%.

The analyst said that the 51% attack on the Bitcoin Cash network would cost less than $10,000 an hour.  Indicators such as hashrate and commissions are not directly related to the price of the cryptotype. However, the fact that there are so few transactions with Bitcoin Cash may suggest that users &apos; interest in BCH is declining, which in turn may affect the price.  Last month, it was reported that the Bitcoin Cash network became vulnerable to an attack by 51% after the hacking.

Also a mast when they ate chips for the night or spent the weekend hugging burgers or pizza. Something tells me I'm not the only one doing that, and I'm not the only one who's left alone with the pimples and the fatty, like the butter of the anointed, the skin.  Usually, after that, I start going through all the stages of denial, bidding, trade.  The cheapest bottle is sold for 510 in stores. You have to keep it in the fridge and use it once or twice a week, not more often.  You don't have to take it easy because you're squeezing your face, and you feel like a Dothraki, who beats all the enemies, and who's got hundreds of tight braids. I don't recommend using it twice a week either: dry your face to hell, and then you'll walk around.  I've got 10 to 15 minutes to dry, but that's because my skin and I have already negotiated. You start with five minutes and we'll see about that.  After feeling great. The face is fresh, clean, not fat, and by morning the pimples and all that redness are dried up.

His main promise is to bring the skin into a qualitatively new form in 30 days, thanks to AHA/BHA/PHA acids and niacinamide.   Niacinamide is a very cool component if you have acne, acne, and extended pores due to age or unnecessary serum production. I do, so I know what craters are around my nose. It's a form of vitamin B3, which actually helps with sleeping, helps with the pore problem, purifies them, equalizes the tone of the skin, and generally makes it more stable and strong. Niacyamid has 2% concentration in tonic, this percentage works well with inflammation and post-acne.   When you read feedback on websites, you can find a lot about sticky facial film and stuffed pores on combined and fat skin. And that's actually why I stopped using it at first, until I read that it's a common practice for AHA/BHA acids: the first time there may be a film, you just have to try to go home with it for a while or put it on the night, gradually injecting it twice a day -- into the peeled skin in the morning and in the evening.  At first, I was very jackaling on sticky film, after a week of use, it went missing, my face started to shine like I was a peeled kettle, not a fried greasy oil pancake.   I thought the best thing he's doing is working with pores: I've narrowed down even the widest craters at my nose, and those that haven't gone terrified have become just clean and less like a portal to dirty Narnia.   - It's always not available, you find it, you grab it.  - A tight film for the first few days, you need to get used to it, but it's worth it. - The smell of mint, it seems like you're rubbing your face with liquid drol."

This October is an awful fucking thing to do, so it's easy to shake Pharaoh's mummy. But what if the cosplay isn't what you've been going for all these years? I don't know what about the micro-banks from the luxury segment worth equal to the value of the wing of the beaver, let's leave it rich. I couldn't cope with Korean diversity without the help of the room either, because it's hard to understand whether the cream is in a bank or a homunculus.

My friends promise not to clean up alcohol every Friday, but they won't. So with the cream, he's not gonna get rid of the bruises, but he's moisturizing well. It's not a fat joke about your boyfriend, it's not annoying. It's written that with an extract of ginseng and chicken tea, but I doubt they know each other.  Lifehak, if your eyes are as dry as a duck, don't spare 15 minutes, put on a fat layer of cream and wait until it soaks up. You can have a glass of wine at this time, but it's not accurate.  The price spares you, unlike the pants that don't fit, because you're burning up in the fall - 249 rubles into the makeup magnet at a discount.

To be honest, I miss the canal and the makeup, but my health is more expensive.  But it's almost gone, and you can even use something other than an eyebrow pencil and a moisturizer. (Gypsy makeup, miss 2007 and cherry blazer!) Recently, I even reached out to PALETKA TENA.  But in the summer of Byuti-ascetism, not only did I heal and almost evict from the face of the pimple (by the way, the pimples and all the black dots are absolute okay, they don't make you worse or better, and they shouldn't affect self-esteem, meh, everything happens, everything is corrected), but they also found a means to give the princess half the kingdom and the soul, if necessary, it's a blue herbal lotion. Amazing, isn't it?  If I was paid every time I was campaigning for someone with fat and troubley skin to buy this lotion, I'd be bumming around the track because the cosmetologist should recommend the cure, and I wouldn't be asked.  Anyway, it's the best thing that's ever happened to my face during a period of fat blushes instead of a face and a constant pimple. By the way, they've already moved to Sheba, but we're gonna kick them out.  Lotion's good for the fat and troubled skin, if you've got a palate on your nose at the end of the day or a pimple in front of your period, please go by, witch.  If you've read Andy Warhol's biography (although I doubt you read anything other than TV channels at all), you know he went to the store every month for blue water.

Anyway, tonic is the very blue water, the only thing that helped him and me (there's an option that only works for talented people and people with high chucks).  In menthol and camphore, which are responsible for BRIS after application, it cools God's way, but it doesn't rip like pure zones as a kid, especially does you good when there's painful inflammation. Kamfora cleans the fat clean. There's alcohol in the compound, it could be a trigger for a lot of people.  Smells pretty strong, doesn't fit without a rest, but I'm just getting in. My love is so strong that I: (a) WAIT for the moment when I put lotion b on my face to keep one jar at home, one on my desk, and a miniatur in my bag to use during the day.  I've had almost all the inflammations, the pores have become less visible, and the skin isn't very fat even in the morning. I'm gonna use three tools from this line, and I'm gonna tell you about it later, but so far, it's lotion.  Attention here again, if you don't have a very fat, combined or just fat skin, if you think it'll dry up and then you'll jinx me."

3142260,"Parity Tech developer Wei Tang said: “It will take us until September 6th to complete the implementation. This is due not only to the fact that we adopted EIP late but also to the fact that we are engaged in large-scale processing of the code structure. ”  It was assumed that the block number for starting the update in the test network should have been selected on Friday, August 23. Now, however, developers will have to wait for Parity to complete the necessary improvements on its part. According to Tan, it will take 2 weeks.  The main network update was to take place on October 4, before the Devcon conference. Under current conditions, it may be delayed until November, depending on how quickly Parity cope with the task.  However, the Geth client, curated by the Ethereum Foundation, has implemented all the necessary Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP). Currently, about 76% of nodes in the Ethereum network use the Geth client and 21% use the Parity client.  In addition, developers are discussing the issue of increasing gas consumption for certain actions or functions, since changing the settings can lead to the failure of some smart contracts that use fixed gas values ​​in certain scenarios.  Ethereum Foundation developer Martin Svendé said: “We know that because of this, something will break, in theory. But breakdowns can be different. ”  Thus, developers discuss the admissibility of the rejection of some smart contracts. “The problem is that if we ruin some contracts and are asked to unfreeze them, a situation similar to what happened with Parity multi-signature wallets may arise,” Tan said.  In 2017, a bug in the smart contract code led to the freezing of 500,000 ETH on Parity wallets. In this case, the problem may arise not at the level of a separate smart contract, but at the level of the entire Ethereum protocol, if the bugs that the developers are afraid of really show themselves.  In particular, such bugs can be used to carry out attacks by filling blocks with operations with too low commissions, which will lead to an increase in the processing time of blocks.  The release of the Ethereum 2.0 genesis block is scheduled for January 2020, however, the transfer of Istanbul to November or, possibly, later will not affect the second network, as different teams work on these initiatives, and Ethereum 2.0 will become an independent blockchain, which so far will not be connected to a valid PoW chain, Trustnodes notes."
3142261,"The author of the best-selling Black Swan Nassim Nicholas Taleb said that he is closing his account on the American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which he acquired several months ago. A former option trader claims to have faced inadequate customer service on one of the most popular platforms for exchanging digital assets.  “Coinbase, what's going on with you? Why don't you answer the mistakes? ” - Taleb wrote on Twitter, immediately receiving recommendations ""to use any other bitcoin exchange.""  Coinbase support also responded by promising to sort things out. “Too late, I close my account,” Taleb replied. “They answered me as the owner of the account with a blue checkmark, but they ignore the average person.”  Close the Coinbase account Taleb was also not so easy, because the corresponding page did not respond to his requests.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell invited Taleb to register on his exchange and contact him personally in case of problems. Also, their own products for storing cryptocurrencies were offered by the manufacturer of hardware wallets Ledger.  Recently, the performance of the Coinbase platform has often been criticized by users. At the beginning of the week, amid rising Bitcoin prices, the site was temporarily unavailable. It was the same on May 9 and April 29, when there were sharp changes in course. As a result, exchange customers cannot fill out applications when they need it most.  Twitter @ CryptoWhale user graphically depicted Coinbase periods of inaccessibility when the price of bitcoin changed by $ 500 or more.

3142268,"  The fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) has suddenly increased the interest of institutional investors in cryptivates. That was the view expressed by the digital asset director of the Stuttgart Stock Exchange, Ulli Spankowski, at the CryptoCompare conference on Tuesday.  ""In fact, I didn't think something like this would happen because banks and other financial institutions could already store cryptating and trade,"" he said. - Now we see a lot of interest from traditional players.""  AMLD5 has led to the closure or change of jurisdiction for a number of European crypto companies. Deribit, for example, moved from the Netherlands to Panama, calling new demands too high for most customers.  The Stuttgart Stock Exchange provides access to several financial instruments related to cryptovals. It opened the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange (BSDEX) unit, where the Bitcoin is traded in pairs with the euro on the spot market.  ""In all likelihood, the crypt is no longer so bad and illegal. If the regulator says she needs a license, she's full,"" Spankovsky added.  BSDEX serves 120 institutional clients and maintains an ""open relationship"" with the German financial regulator. Under the new legislation, it can act as a trusted gateway to digital assets.  ""We could open the gate to cryptivates because the traditional finance industry is already connected to us at the European level. That's where our gold mine is,"" Spankovsky said."
3142269,"  The British court ordered the stock exchange to cry Bitfinex to freeze assets worth $860,000 in bitcoin. As the stock market and the crypto-analytical company Chainalysis learned, they were linked to extortion programs, reporting to the New Money Review.  The insurance company of the victim of the attack, on the face of an unnamed firm, paid the perpetrators $950,000 (109.25 BTC) and went to court. Some of the funds were taken to the violet and were not available for further tracking, while 96 BTC went to the Bitfinex-controlled address.  The court ordered the freezing of these assets and requested the identity of the purse owner from Bitfinex. According to the New Money Review, this is the first time that the High Court of England and Wales has agreed to treat Bitcoin as property.  The Director of Public Affairs, Chainalysis Maddy Kennedy, stated: ""The head of cyber insurers used the Chainalysis software in an investigation into the payment to the extortion program he made on behalf of the client to track the movements of funds from the point of payment of the ransom to known services, such as exchanges.""  Bitfinex and her parent company, iFinex, were initially involved in the case as defendants. However, the exchange itself explained that it had assisted the plaintiff in the discovery of assets and was not charged with any crime.  ""Bitfinex uses a reliable system to help law enforcement agencies and plaintiffs, as in this case,"" was reported to the company. As we understand it, the plaintiff's attention is no longer directed to the Bitfinex platform. Bitfinex now appears to be a completely innocent party involved in this offence.""  According to the court order, the Bitfinex was to hand over the identity of the perpetrator to the court before 18 January, but no further action was reported by the exchange."

3142276,"The Crypto com cryptation platform reportedly led a private funding round of $18.9 million for the new NFT block platform from Enjin.  Enjin announced the news on Wednesday along with the DFG Group, BlockTower, and Arrington XRP Capital among other investors in private sales.  The platform, known as ""Efinity"", is a Polkadot-based NFT blocker that is reported to offer greater scalability for members of the expanding NFT space.  In detail, describing the specifications of the new NFT block, the announcement states that Efinity will have an initial capacity to process transactions every six seconds. The project team plans to use the consensus Proof-of-Stake to achieve scalability of up to 1,000 transactions per second.  In addition to scalability, Enjin will also seek networking in NFT as part of an effort to create a real metaverse NFT.  Thus, Enjin is working on a new standard of currents called ""Paratoken"", designed to ensure the functionality of cross-checks for NFT. With Paratokens, market participants will be able to transfer digital collection items from other blocks to the Efinity ecosystem.  According to Angin, Paratokens expands the ERC-1155 currents standard, created by the company as early as 2018. Commenting on the importance of cross-block functionality for NFT, Co-founder Enjin and Technical Director Witek Radomski stated: ""The digital assets must exist in meta-verse blocks. The opening of liquidity to several lockbacks and use scenarios will link the broad ecosystem of creators, buyers and sellers.  The Efinity Block will also have its own current called Efinity Token (EFI). Enjin Coin (ENJ) holders can bet on ENJ to earn EFI, which serves as the fuel for processing transactions on the new NFT network. EFI will also serve as a control point for the Efinity community.  In 2021, Enjin Coin made a huge profit against the growing interest in NFT. Token ENJ grew more than eightfold in March and grew by more than 1,700 percent since the beginning of the year."

Developers have come up with a new approach to the implementation of transactions: they are now automatically implemented when there are any external conditions (for example, when the US dollar reaches a certain value). Using smart contracts allows you to significantly expand the scalability of the Lightning Network and achieve a huge transaction processing speed - more than 1 million per second.  The new version of LN uses oracles - trusted nodes, which translate external data into smart contracts. For the test implementation of the network, the developers submitted an oracle, which translates the US dollar exchange rate, converting it into Satoshi."

3142294,"The Financial Services Department of the State of New York submitted a proposal to amend licensing regulations on Wednesday, which would make it easier for companies to engage in cryptivistic business within their jurisdiction. Reuters write about it.  By 10 August, the regulator intends to collect public feedback on its initiative. It aims to reduce the ""real and perceived difficulties"" that companies face in obtaining a BitLicense licence, established in 2015.  Under the new conditions, entrepreneurs would be able to obtain limited licences, which would be valid only if they cooperated with fully licensed companies.  ""We expect that, over time, legal entities wishing to obtain a restricted licence will seek and eventually receive a full BitLicense,"" the proposal's authors report.  At the time of BitLicense's development, the regulator was skeptical about the industry's cryptization. Over time, they have become a feature of the broader financial technology industry, in which many major economic activity centres are interested.  However, obtaining a licence to work with cryptovates in New York could still be extended for several years by industry representatives. To date, only 25 companies, including Tagomi, Circle and Robinhood, have been able to become owners.  Also on Wednesday, the Department announced the simplification of the process of adding new coins to licensed services. To this end, they will be provided with a list of pre-approved digital assets that BitLicense holders will be able to add on a self-certification basis without seeking additional authorization.  In 2015, Kraken refused to continue its work in New York City, calling the BitLicense ""a creation so terrible, so violent that even Kraken does not have the courage to look at its disgusting, huge, sharp teeth""."

3142302,"  The Economic Adviser of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), who is the centre for economic and monetary research, and the Head of Research, Hen Song Shin (Hyun Song Shin), said that cryptivates should be treated in the same way as stocks or bonds.  Shin's words echo the views of the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who called for regulation to be cryptized rather than ""directly banned"" in March this year. Carney argued that it was appropriate to include the digital currency ecosystem in the rest of the financial system, subjecting it to the same regulatory approach and the same ""strength standards"".  Although the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not regard Bitcoin or Ethereum as securities, SEC head Jay Clayton has previously stated that all of the current ICOs that SEC has seen so far are considered shares. At a Senate hearing in February, Clayton said that if a company issues a current or a coin that over time values depending on the company's performance, it is considered a security document.  In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Clayton confirmed the regulatory authority &apos; s position that currents and digital assets often function as securities and should therefore be regulated as such."

The founder of SkyBridge Capital compared the BTC to the shares of Amazon, which have jumped 64 times since 2009. Since the inception of the IT giant in the past many years, the range of fluctuations has significantly reduced the value of its shares. Bitcoin will go the same way, I'm sure Skaramucci.  On Friday, he said companies should keep at least some of their financial reserves in the BTC. In the future, Bitcoin will become the world's leading currency unless the US authorities release a digital version of the dollar.  The founder of SkyBridge Capital also pointed to the great potential of the etherium, which attracts an increasing number of developers of various services. Note that the Scramucci hedge fund controls the bitcoins for $600 million."

Unlike the creators of these projects, they do not have long-term plans and prefer to flee with the opportunity to charge a substantial amount of money.  Since the introduction of Degenomics, the community's attention has been drawn to the KPER and KORE projects. The first was the clone developed by the designer of the yearn finance, Andre Cronier Keep3r Network (KP3R), and the second, the cVault finance (CORE). While the originals retain tens of millions of dollars in capitalization, KPER and KORE were waiting for a different fate. The creators used the open-source power of the contract to remove user assets from the respective liquidity pools.  Both current currents are near-zero marks. At the same time, KPER developed to a $5 million capitalization.  CEO Cryptofund Three Arrows Capital Su Zhu believes that the dominance of fraudsters and forks of known projects can be a sign of peaking in this market sector. At the same time, he states that it may be unreasonable to open a short position on the DeFi-space.

MicroStrategy reported the purchase of $5,050 bitcoins for $243 million this week, bringing its position to 114,042 BTCs or $5.3 billion at current rates. This figure exceeds the cash reserves of 80 per cent of non-financial companies on the S&P 500 list, as shown by Bloomberg data.  Microsoft was betting on bitcoin in mid-2020, and since then has been constantly increasing its investment, explaining the desire to hedge the risk of the dollar falling. It was later followed by other companies, including Tesla and Square.  At the same time, less risk-prone firms continued to accumulate reserves in traditional currency. Thus, in the second quarter, non-financial companies increased their reserves by 12 per cent over the previous year, against the background of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."

""I'm in touch with the lawyers. Senstebeu refuses to translate me to pursue his own interests,"" writes Invancheglo, who left IOTA Foundation about a year ago, but has been on the board of directors of the project all this time.  Senstebeux issued a statement in response, in which he reported that he and Invancheglo had decided last week to break off their cooperation ""professionally and on a friendly basis"".  ""It appears that he was smoldering at the last minute and did what he unfortunately did many times in the history of IOTA by playing a tirad, because the best defense is an attack,"" Sanstebeux added.  Senstebö also reported the existence of a chronicle of all events and promised to publish it on Monday. According to him, Invancheglo refused to read the letter and to make corrections, although he was invited to do so.  According to Invancheglo's own statement, the conflict could be linked to funding the JINN Labs project, which was founded by Sanstebeux in 2014 to develop equipment to carry out distributed calculations. It is believed that the unit is still working on a ""tropical microprocessor"" for IOTA. Even before the conflict with Invancheglo, Sanstebeux promised to answer all the questions about JINN Labs this Monday.  In response to a comment that the current situation could be resolved on a personal basis, Invancheglo wrote: ""The IOTA community is also involved because the IOT directors are about to be accused of embezzlement.

3142380,"Large Bitcoin movements involving stock purses are observed at the block office level on this Wednesday.  According to the CryptoQuant analysis platform, a few hours ago, Bitfinex's purses were predisposed by Bitfinex for two transactions on 7,901 BTC and 10,474 BTC. The total value of the Bitcoin traded in 24 hours was $1.2 billion.  It is usually impossible to determine with certainty whether the assets were transferred by investors from outside or whether the stock exchange itself operated using unknown wallets, so any projections remain at the level of guesses. This applies both to the withdrawal of the bitcoins, i.e. the intended purchases, and to the introduction. However, in the present case, the Technical Director of Bitfinex Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the translations were not made by them.  ""The good bitcoin revenues today come to Bitfinex,"" he wrote.  Several large transfers to 1,000 BTCs and more were observed on the Binance and Bitfinex exchanges. According to ViewBase, together with this, the total stock balance of bitcoin increased by 1.5 per cent. The largest asset on the stock market was released in USDT – $125 million.  There are several main reasons for such transfers. The most obvious is sales. At the same time, ""kitas"" can move bitcoins only to create the appearance of forthcoming sales in order to cause depreciation and buy an asset at a better price, since, in addition to processing boards, they are in fact worthless. Alternatively, bitcoins can be moved for conversion to altcoins, which have recently shown higher results than the first crypthalate.  Twitter account Unfolded notes that the offer of bitcoin on over-the-counter platforms is declining throughout 2021. This week, the rest of the bitcoin in the known OTC wallets reached a minimum of 6,000 BTC. ""This suggests that the demand of large investors on these platforms exceeds the supply,"" the analysts say."

So last year did not become the famous analog of the December 2017 Rally, and it is only now that we are entering a phase of aggressive growth.  On Saturday, January 23, the BTC grew to $33,400 on some commercial sites. The coin was able to recover from the shock drop to $30,000.  Weiss' report indicates that in 2021, a huge Bitcoin takeoff would bring it to $325,000.  A key development in the industry will be a massive entry into the institutional capital cryptosphere. Giants like Grayscale and Microsoft have already invested in the BTC. These companies have set a trend for the entire market, so more large investors are expected to enter digital assets this year.  Researchers have emphasized that gold and fiat money are indeficit assets. If the gold decreases, the manufacturers will expand their search for metal. Central banks have become much more likely to print than they used to be.  Unlike these two instruments, bitcoin is a scarce asset. Only 21 million coins will be produced. Accordingly, as the date of production of the last BTC approaches, demand will increase, which will have a positive impact on the price of the cryptation."

3142391,"  The Chief Cryptographer Riple David Schwartz is of the view that banks are unlikely to deploy a blockchain for international transactions in the foreseeable future, citing problems with low network scalability and privacy.  In an interview with Reuters Schwartz, he argued that while banks recognized the potential of block-chamber technology to reduce transaction time and costs, technology was still not scalable, it was not private enough to be used by banks globally.  *Ripple claims that the xCurrent protocol offers instantaneous payments, which makes it higher than the existing payment networks. However, Schwartz notes that xCurrent is ""not a distributed registry"". In the case of xCurrent, network single-range nodes do not have access to a common registry, which is the basis for leading blocks such as Ethereum (ETH) or Hyperledger.  *Marcus Tremaher, Senior Vice President of Ripple, said that the firm had launched a project offering bank ""classical"" lock-in payments. The banks, however, rejected the initiative, citing the fact that it was not possible simply to put the whole world on lockdown.  According to Reuters, a number of banks have tested and incorporated the Ripple xCurrent technology for international payments, which may eventually link them to distributed registries.  In May, financial institutions that took part in the Ripple xRapid pilot platform reported low transaction costs in the area of 40-79 per cent, as well as significant improvements in transaction time ranging from 2-3 days to ""just over two minutes""."

Without receiving the same amount of BCH coins in addition to the existing 872 BTC, the investor suffered a 2.4 million-dollar loss.  In the future, Gatehub allegedly did not inform clients of a technical failure that prevented him from transferring the bitcoins to Bitstamp.

According to the Minister, this is a serious problem because unregistered mining companies consume up to 1,200 MW of electricity. By comparison, the whole of Kazakhstan consumes about 12,000 MW. In the course of the report, Magzum Mirzagaliyev informed the President of Kazakhstan of the measures applied to the mining companies engaged in illegal activities.  Kasim-Jomart Tokaev ordered that the mining issues be dealt with in law as soon as possible. He stressed that changes in the legislative framework should not prevent registered companies from producing crypthalates.  The President of the Kazakhstan Association of Blocking Technologies, Sapar Ahmetov, stated that a working group had been set up under the Ministry of Energy, with the participation of the Association and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, Atameken, which was studying new methods of detecting illegal mining cryptically.   According to the chairman, the situation with regard to engineering is stable in Kazakhstan. Under the changes in Kazakhstan &apos; s legislation, mining companies will pay an additional tax on the State &apos; s budget as of 1 January.  The Government of Kazakhstan &apos; s loyal attitude towards engineering is well founded. According to data from the National Association of Blocks and the Data Center Industry of Kazakhstan, the annual contribution of legal engineers is estimated at $230 million.   The number of Mayners in Kazakhstan has increased since July due to the relocation of Chinese entrepreneurs, resulting in an increase in the proportion of hashrate, which rose to 18.1% of Bitcoin's total hashrate."
3142398,"According to CoinDesk, the XDC is released in the public version of the Corda block. It was designed to meet the requirements of regulators and ""opens doors to various DeFi applications based on distributed registry technology"". In the first phase, 1 million XDCs will be released to support applications in the Corda Network.  ""XDC is an independent digital currency. It's being released as an exchange point for the Cordite Society members and will be distributed evenly among them,"" said former RBS and CEO Cordite banker Richard Crooke.  Each node on the Corda Network will be presented to a legal entity, whose identity will be confirmed by a special certificate. Firms that will take part in the management of the Cordite through a decentralized autonomous organization will automatically undergo all necessary checks. According to Kruku, this would meet the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which is not compatible with the Etherum-based DeFi applications.  ""Regulators have established requirements for digital currencies and the XDC is in compliance with these standards. It meets the requirements of most jurisdictions as a digital currency, so we're one step ahead. We're bitcoin or the next generation's XRP, says Crooke. - All services in the financial industry have to deal with customer identification from the start, while at the same time ensuring participants' privacy. Today, there are many deFi projects, but if their technology does not solve this problem, they seem to ignore the requirements and be asked to be pursued by regulators.""  In addition, according to Kruk, the XDC code can be used to launch digital currencies of central banks based on Corda.  The British institutional platform BCB Prime Services, which works with Bitstamp, Coinbase, Galaxy and Kraken, will provide over-the-counter liquidity and XDC storage services."

3142411,"The COMP current distribution model in the Computer crypto-credit protocol will undergo a fundamental change in two days, written by CoinDesk.  On this Tuesday, a proposal was approved that would force users to leave the most risky markets, such as Basic Attention Token (BAT) and 0x (ZRX), in favour of the stylcoins. The daily awards will continue to be 2,880 COMPs. However, distribution will no longer be based on interest paid or received by users, but on the dollar value of the assets involved.  It was originally expected that users with the greatest demand for the services of the Compendium would receive the most rewards. In practice, it has been found that the huge difference between the value of COMP's earnings and the price on the market results in investors deliberately making and borrowing assets solely for the purpose of generating currents.  Fears for future changes were expressed by the representatives of MackerDAO. They're expecting a surge of interest in the DAI stampede produced by the organization. As a result, a large portion of the DAI volume can be blocked in the Company, and the supply of the stylcoin will fall on the market.  On the other hand, such a system would be more attractive to ordinary users, which in turn could increase the relative demand for COMP.  ""Users participating in the COMP pharming are not interested in it as an asset to manage the protocol. They probably regularly sell the COMPs they earn. This change will result in COMP being distributed to users with long-term views or Walkers,"" says the publication.  Currently, the total amount of assets frozen in the Compendium is about $1 billion, making it the largest deFi-protocol on the market. The price of COMP dropped to $215 after reaching a maximum of $373 on June 21st."

The Canadian company Kik Interactive, the developer of the Kik messenger, has been suing the regulator since last year. SEC claims that the company violated the securities law when it conducted the Kin currentsail in 2017.  The Court ordered Kik Interactive to provide SEC with the requested information. The regulator will also interrogate the Operations Director and Technical Adviser, Kik Tanner Philippe, on 29 January.  This step follows Kik &apos; s recent request for a formal date for the trial. Startup continues to argue that SEC does not have strong evidence to support claims, and Director General Ted Livingston says he wants to appear in court as soon as possible.  Both parties had previously agreed on the completion of the trial by June 2020, but court documents published on 9 January had shown that Kik objected to SEC &apos; s demands for testimony, which could delay the scheduled completion of the case.  Also in January, the CEO of Telegram, Pavel Durov, testified that the company was in breach of the US Securities Act for a currentsale of $1.7 in 2018.

Also, a potential buyer should remember that, depending on the structure, some currents may be derivatives, goods, or securities.  ""It's always a certain risk, no matter how well-written it is or the business plan of the project. Your best defense is a thorough study of currents and caution,"" the memo says.  The manual also states that before investing in ICO, it is necessary to find out about the organizers of the project and whether they themselves are involved in their initial placement of coins.  The agency also refers to a study according to which more than 50 per cent of ICO Startups ceased to exist during the first four months following the end of the currents.  ""Beware of promises of rapid enrichment or guaranteed returns. There is no investment with guarantees,"" the recommendation says.  In May, CFTC published a guide for exchanges and clearing centres that plan to start working with derivatives of financial instruments on the base."

In the document, the organization establishes four tasks to be completed before the official launch of the Libra network. The first of these tasks is the five major partners that have full feet for the network.  The next steps involve an increase in the number of partners deploying their own feet to verify the network.  Here's a step-by-step plan to increase the bark in the Libra network.  Five full-head partners in the network; 25 full-neck partners in the network; 75 full-neck partners in the network; 100 full-neck partners in the network; according to the organization, the number of feet managed by different partners will help determine the development of the project and how close it is to being finalized.  In preparation for launch, Libra Association launched the Pre-mainnet test network, which allows a number of selected partners to turn their noses and establish a link to verify network stability.  Earlier, iHodl Russia reported that Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe had decided to give up official Libra support.

3142446,"Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and bitcoin-enthusiast Jimmy Song approved the terms of the bet, which they agreed to hold in advance, writes the Decrypt portal.  The conditions are as follows: if 15 unique decentralized applications have 10,000 daily and 100,000 monthly active users for 6 months, until May 23, 2023, Song will pay 810.8 ETH ($ 1,673,333); otherwise, Lubin will have to say goodbye to 69.74 BTC ($ 550156).  The reason for choosing such non-rounded values ​​is that each initially set at $ 700,000, but the decline in the market did its job. Lubin and Song agreed on holding a bet at last year’s Consensus conference, where the latter favored the idea of ​​“Bitcoin, but not the blockchain,” and spoke of Ethereum as follows: “I see nothing but abstruse terms”  The amounts of bets were specially set sufficiently weighty for both participants. It is possible that by the time of the calculations in 2023 in fiat terms the losses of the losing side will be much higher.  “This is the most painful rate,” said Song. “Personal interest, that's the whole point.”  “Jimmy’s position is that there are no decent applications on the blockchain, and the only thing that matters is bitcoin,” Lubin said. - I recognize Bitcoin as a fantastic invention and see a narrow scope for what is created on its basis. We love it, but decentralized applications are also really useful. ”  The essence of the dispute comes down to the ability of decentralized applications to meet the expectations placed on them, in particular with the help of Ethereum. The song is confident that centralized technologies will always be faster and more convenient in the context of development and does not see the prospects for the development of decentralized networks as an alternative to existing centralized solutions.  “It may happen that many useful applications will be created on the basis of Ethereum and they will be decentralized enough, but they will not meet these two criteria. Then I will lose, while the ecosystem will show its strength, ”Lubin added."

3142457,"Digital asset management company Grayscale reported in an investment report for the 3rd quarter that investment in its products reached $ 330 million this year.  The report was published on Thursday and is a description of the company's investment activities in July, August and September 2018 - during this period Grayscale raised $ 81.1 million. Thus, if we consider that in the first six months, about $ 250 million were invested in the company's investment products, in total, this gives almost $ 330 million. This is better than the figures for 2017 (then $ 25 million was raised in the 3rd quarter), and 2016 ($ 17 million). “This September was the best in terms of investment inflows than any other September since our business began.”  According to Michael Zonnenstein, Managing Director of the company, at the moment investors are showing more interest in the family of crypto-investment products than ever. And this is despite the fact that since the beginning of the year the crypto-market has sunk by 70%. In the third quarter of 2018, institutional investors accounted for up to 70% of investment in Grayscale, and for all 9 months of 2018 - 59%. In total, the New York-based company Grayscale manages $ 1.5 billion, making it one of the largest crypto investors in the world.  In addition, according to Sonnenstein, institutional investors come to his company more aware of the digital asset market and look at the crypto market as a long-term investment area.  “We are not discussing the fundamentals and even something more advanced with investors. We are discussing the real uses of crypto technology. These are people who make decisions based on data. They look at information about transaction growth, decisions for scaling, the number of nodes. And they seriously understand all these figures and use them as a thermometer to measure the health of specific assets. Investors come very knowledgeably, their level of understanding of technology is very deep. ”  It should be noted that Grayscale products still feel the bearish grip of the crypto market. If you do not take into account the investment products of the company based on Bitcoin and XRP, then the net profit from its 7 other funds in Q3 2018 decreased. The biggest losses fell on the Ethereum trust fund (-46%), and the smallest - on the Digital Large Cap fund, that is, the fund of several large cryptocurrencies (-3%).  As for the investment Bitcoin Fund, the profit from it in Q3 2018 increased by 12.6%, but if we take into account the first 9 months of 2018, it fell by 54.7%. However, if we take an even earlier point of reference (the foundation of the fund was September 25, 2013), then the profit from it, according to the report, was 4,635.7%.  Sonnenstein hinted that by the end of the year the family of investment products of the company was waiting for replenishment, but added that Grayscale ""is not yet ready to discuss this issue."""
3142458,"In fact, when Bitfinex had problems two years ago and USDT fell in price, this is all pure speculation. They were required to maintain the rate at a 1: 1 level. For these deviations of 1-4%, you can easily file a class action lawsuit against them. If they are not market makers themselves, then they must have an agreement with market makers, to whom they will provide liquidity and a buyback guarantee at a 1: 1 rate, and he must maintain the rate at a level close to 1: 1 and earn on small deviations. Only short-term slippage in the glass is possible in case of large orders, with a subsequent return of the rate back.  If you continue to understand, then the issuer is obliged to provide its own resource, where at any time, without the participation of 3 persons, it would be possible to change your USDT to 1 USD. In this case, Bitfinex itself was supposed to act as an exchanger with a guaranteed 1: 1 in spite of any panic. It doesn't matter who makes money on the USDT panics, the issuer or the market maker. It is important that having held an underestimated rate 2 years ago for 2 months, they either broke the law. If not, they showed that it was just a candy wrapper 🤷‍♂️.  Why can the price be kept lower? First, bad news is launched on the market, and then the market maker sets up a maintenance cost of 1.03 USDT: 1 USD in his trading robot, and keeps the given rate by filling the supply and demand order books. And only then we agree to buy at this rate or wait for the weather from the sea. In relation to stablecoins, the value is formed by the market maker, the influence of market relations is minimal here. Even if it is revealed that USDT does not have 100% collateral, they simply have to maintain the price level of $ 1. But they are obliged only if they received at least some permission to issue USDT from regulators. If they just issued tokens, without asking anyone how to write a white paper, indicating that each token will be confirmed by keeping $ 1 in the bank, or by another type of value, then the market price will be formed only by our belief in their white paper. and all this stability is written with a pitchfork on the water.  On the Tether Limited website, it seems like you can make the purchase and sale of USDT tokens, but the user must provide proof of identity in English. What course was there two years ago, I do not know. Perhaps only market makers made money on all this, but where are the regulators looking then? A market maker at large sites is not just an individual person, they receive permission (or license) for their activities."

Smells like headaches.  Consistence is very liquid, a dosage in the form of a puppet, and I've had two fences at the end of my hair. I put it on a dry groove (dry in a literal sense, someone's still returning 2007 and fucking blonde to brunette), rubbing my palms.  It drys quickly, hair doesn't glue, removes the cannon and treats it, but there's no effect, serum and serum for 429 rubles.  Minus one for me-- the smell disappears exactly when you're hand-in-hand putting a gun on your hair. It's pathetic, I'd like to stink of coriander longer.

I don't know what I had to put in a can to make it smell like the best cake in the world. And since I'm the man for whom the dough is a clean trigger, and I'm also a side-activator and a pimple, I have to put vanilla in my head and hope for the best.  Among the other non-obvious pros: when I had a blond, he was very good at supporting him out of the dry zone. Dark hair is beautiful and soft.  The smell of cream buns will accompany you all day. So if you've got a non-cool, get ready to sit and bite a piece of hair at some point.   If you created something that smells better than vanilla, I don't know, but it's a yogh-leg soul gel.

3142488,"I think I'm serious about legitizing the three-day weekend and adding the same day that yesterday doesn't have to go anywhere and tomorrow, too.  Well, it's been a while since we've had any good news. Everyone knows a company like Amway. One day my mom gave me some metallic pots for the dishes, hoping I'd become a hostess. And, you know, they've been working on the doll: pans are wiped to their primordial state. When I'm angry, I wash dishes or wash them. Let go of God. But now it's not about my mistress' skeleton and my own psychoanalyst, it's about having an Artistry exit line. Brand is considered a bonus, but prices are basically tolerant, very, I'd say, tolerant. We'll talk in detail about the Escentials line, they say they're inspired by nature itself. Man, why isn't anyone but me inspired by borsch? This post was inspired by soup from smoked tomatoes in two sticks. He's great. I just wanted to share it with the world. It's all nature and nature.  The line includes water-based gel, makeup napkins, lotion and moisturizing cream. The main function of all products is to moisturize, protect against environmental impacts, help with the fat balance (not confused with the balance on the phone), and feed the skin throughout the day.  I've got a fest with my skin in the summer: in the morning, you can fry balshes, in the afternoon, she's ready to crack from dryness, but at night again, it's like a painting of salum. As a matter of principle, I've come to accept and realize that in order to fix this, you have to eat normally and be less nervous, not McDonald's cakes and work in advertising.  But I'm still using a billion withdrawals for skin with a fat control function. On the whole, I liked the line. Unless you care what I think. Minus one: Smell. It's too sharp and too chemical. But that's my opinion again. I like makeup to smell like nothing or like food.  Linear favorites are makeup napkins, lazy, lying down, but you're bathing, and you're actually lying there. Plus, they don't smell (the only ones in the series) and quickly wash the mascara, tears after work day, and my amazing freckles. The mascara's getting better than you. After that, it doesn't feel like there's a little Kiss fan in front of you in the mirror.  The second favorite is lotion. I put it up to makeup, soaks in fast, lightly, half a day's skin really isn't fat (on the side of the ointment - not working) and looks fresh and not extinct, which you don't say about your look. Minus the smell. But it tastes like color, my friends. Someone's perfume and vanilla seems to be doing okay.  Medium pricer for 700-800, minus one: I didn't see them selling anywhere. What's that supposed to mean? I refuse. I only want to order rolls in delivery."

But there are people (I) who are dumbly hating the funds that need to be put on the ground: sticky then everything. Me, the clothes, the dog, the dresser on which she carried the remains of the cream off her side. I'm not the awful one, I have a girlfriend.  Soul oil in this sense is the solution -- it's a good moisturizer and it feeds the skin, but at the same time it smells good and it smells good, and it doesn't leave a feeling of tightness on the skin. (It's when after the bathtub you've washed yourself in intensive washing mode and now hs what to do, because the wool sweater is the size of a cat.) The butter is like gel, but it's more fatter. Yeah, you can't fire a cutlet, but the investment in your avitaminous carcass isn't bad, especially if you like to brush it with a brush and scrape it pretty. Use it as a shower gel, but it's as simple as I would explain how to breathe and why.  There are more expensive analogs-- loxytan oil and Kills-- they both smell great, but the effect is the same as the planet's organics. So if you see a jar in the store, take three."

3142494,"I don't know what I'm gonna write about perfume, even though it's almost night in the yard, and I'm not much of a perfume critic.  Today, the first le labo boutique opened in Moscow, and I love the brand, even though it's not 300, and it's also a collection of fragrances that I've been thinking about doing for a long time who, like me, is your sniff of the Russian spill. Anyway, maybe I'll save your money and tell you about my favorites, 'cause you can spend your regional salary there at a time.  I'm gonna warn you that expertise doesn't smell any higher or lower notes, just the feeling, the smell of a leaked salary, and the hardcore.   1. My pure top, 10 of 10 is said to be santal 33. It's a clean summer in a bottle, late spring and nectar juice. It's a fresh pickle salad, dew, a fresh paper, a book on the beach. A bouquet of lorries bought from the subway and a branch of sirens.  It's especially cool to be exposed to skin and clothing from skin and eco-skins. If you hear it once, you're gonna get to know it all.  Aromat's pretty popular, so be prepared that there might be more than one of you at the party.   2. Thé Noir 29. It's viscous and dark as a red atlas dress. Smells like new shoes, as they feel, a little uncomfortable and wiping, but so beautiful. Like a bag in a duster, an evening in the velvet chairs of a theater or a movie.  A note of cigarettes in a bag, a tree after rain and musk.  It's a little heavy and exciting for me.   3. Another 13. Body skin aromat and purity. It smells like you just put some fresh underwear on your bed, put some clean pajamas on, and went to bed after the bath. Could open up like a glittered white shirt or a hospital bandage of bandages.  Each opens up a little bit in a new way, highlighting the natural smell of human skin. Clean glass, domestic chemistry, a little asphalt after rain.   4. All right, all right, all right, all right, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Patchuli 24. Clean patchuli, eastern market and spice. A bunch of juicy peaches, gold ornaments, and bright tissue cubes. Smells like bazaar noise, tin lanterns, sweets. It's a very clear and specific fragrance.   5. Benjoin 19. The romat that's in the boutique is designed specifically for Moscow. It smells like cough, smoke, soot, and citrus in the form of candy. A little red lipstick and powder. It's like when you get in a new, most beautiful dress and you get in a cab and you paint your lips while you look in the rear-view mirror and there's a pink sunset behind the window.  It's very similar to elevin haur byredo, the same hare and sweetness, only with a more pronounced smoke fragrance.    It's my favorite, I hope it helps you.   I'm gonna pull myself together, and I'm gonna make a biredo and lush guide. Long live the pouring of money for perfume. Katya was with you as a scent-sniffer and a night-time graphomania."
3142495,"Bitcoin has risen to $9,500 this Wednesday, the highest since June 24. The movement followed the emergence of positive dynamics in the altcoin segment and the nine-year maximum gold.  According to CoinDesk's analyst, keeping the course above the resistance $9,330 will mark the end of the bear trend at a maximum of $10,400 on June 1.  Although digital gold is far from its historical maximum, real dragmetal now sells over $1,800 for the first time in nine years and only 6% below the record $1,920 recorded in September 2011. It is likely that investors' interest in it is caused by the negative returns of American bonds adjusted for inflation, which analysts consider.  Against this background, experts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of bitcoin. ""Bitcoin's market is growing in institutional acceptance and awareness of this class of assets, which should have a positive effect on long-term appreciation,"" said Bittrex Global Stonberg, the operating and financial director of the stock exchange. We see that prominent organizations and individuals, such as Tudor, JPMorgan, Fidelity, are publicly involved in the market, but this is only the tip of the iceberg.  He also noted that, during the crisis, Bitcoin was even less volatile than traditional assets, whereas the stock market no longer seemed so ""traditional"". ""This standard bitcoin is beginning to look attractive as a new class of assets that is not susceptible to printing money by central banks,"" he added.  Analyst Michael van de Popp also believes that bulls may not stop at what they have achieved and move up to $9,600 - 9,700. In the alternative scenario, falling below the weekend minimums of about $8,900 could accelerate sales."

In a letter to investors on the CEO JPMorgan Wednesday, James Diamond announced that the Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in 2010 to mitigate the risks of the US financial system, had worked, but was linked in the past, so it was now important to focus on the future.  ""We are not only slowly moving away from our past, we are also distracted from the questions of the future, "" he wrote. - There are serious emerging issues that need to be addressed quickly: the growth of shadow banking, legal and regulatory status are cryptic, proper and inappropriate use of financial data, proper and ethical use of AI, effective regulation of payment systems..."".  In the same letter, Diamond stated that ""banks play an increasingly smaller role in the financial system"". ""We need competition because it makes the banking industry better, and we need to manage emerging risks at the appropriate level to ensure the safety and reliability of the entire industry.

I just woke up one day and I saw that when you kill shooters and lipsticks not with a washing machine, but with a special device, the skin gets really better. Less dry, inflammable, crumbling, and wobbling. That's why there's no foam/gel/ wash/mouss/god of what else to wash. But I haven't found the perfect replacement yet.  Everything was super with the Bioderma, but it's running out of time, and we're here at 300 Booty. I can't handle ultra-bland yet. The money from the mass market (real, nivea, garrier, etc.) is very smelly to me. But by the way, there's nothing wrong with the garrison, but he's gel. I've been writing about him a number of times.  Oh, by the way, you need to wash your mitellic water, you know, awful huh! It's regular water. That's all I'm saying. This is because, for example, lotion and tonic for 54 rubles from the Clean Line did the same thing as their colleagues for 300-400: the makeup was removed, the skin remained sticky, the tone went perfectly, the matte lipstick had to sweat. It's not like there's a single debate in this world.  As they say, it's bullshit, it's a show, but it's a 54 ruble price. At least it's not pathetic to put it in your face on an industrial scale."

At the time of their arrest, the police also discovered a $1.5 million cryptato from these people.  Australian officials say that this is the largest amount of cryptization confiscated by the authorities in the investigation of such crimes. The seizure was carried out as part of a joint operation between the Australian Federal Police and the Washington State Police, when it was decided to check the alleged drug transport patterns.  The police seized MDMA in 55 in the form of pills and powder. The cryptovals were found in a cold hardware wallet that was among the belongings of these people.  Australian police officials recognize that ""law enforcement agencies are now increasingly operating in a digital environment"".  Despite their innovative potential, cryptists draw the attention of regulators and authorities to the fact that they are too well equipped to circumvent all kinds of checks and regulations.

3142536,"Hong Kong insurance company Blue Cross uses blockchain technology to speed up the process of payments for health insurance, as well as to eliminate fraud in this area.  According to the company, the decision based on the blockchain will speed up the resolution of insurance claims, prevent fraud and reduce costs.  “Blue Cross is the first insurance company in Hong Kong that provides customers from all over the world with the opportunity to use the blockchain,” the company said. “Local insurers Rivals Prudential, HSBC Life and Bowtie Insurance started selling insurance products and processing insurance claims online last year, but they still have blockchains in place.”  It should be noted that the insurance company ZhongAn Online uses the blockchain for checking records and processing claims, however, it only offers this service on the mainland.  “As data and transactions are verified in real time, the risk of fraud is eliminated and claims can be processed faster for more than 200,000 company customers,” said Blue Cross CEO Patrick Wan. He stressed that Blue Cross will also be able to save on its own costs since the blockchain eliminates the need to reconcile data on medical claims between various parties.  The company's blockchain solution is based on the Hyperledger technology, as is the eTrade Connect trade finance network, launched in 2018 with the support of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and twelve banks.  According to William Yeung, co-founder of MediConCen, a Hong Kong-based startup developing medical blockchain-based medical applications, Blue Cross customers can save time.  “The use of the blockchain also means that medical facilities may not hire a large number of support staff for administrative work, but access the Blue Cross network,” he said."

If he lost, he would not lose money, and if he won, he would receive full payment.  ""After talking to several developers, we discovered that other games were attacked using the same exact code (abi forwarder),"" said the representative of EOSBet.  24 hours later, the EOSBet developers managed to correct the error in the code. They also reported that the remaining 463,745 EOS were fully secure on smart contracts.  ""We have now moved ~ 75% of the bankroll (300,000 EOS) from our hot wallet to our reserve. At the same time, we increased the gain from 1% to 4% of the bankroll to keep the maximum rate unchanged,"" reported changes made to the EOSBet team.  According to Unhashed, other fraudsters took advantage of the chaos around the break-in.  For example, the perpetrators used the eosbethicell account name, similar to the official EOSBet wallet (eosbetdice11) account, and sent a small amount of EOS to the hacker who used the bug. The transfer was accompanied by a report stating that if the hacker did not make up for the damage, EOSBet would engage a team of lawyers from China to continue the criminal proceedings. Whether the fraudsters were able to scare their ""college"" has not yet been known.  Last week, a bug in the EOS application of DEOSGames allowed the player to win 24 times in a row."

3142546,"GameStop became the world's most mentioned company in the past week, the name of which became the vindictive name for the victory of retail investors over the downgrading, professional speculators of Wall Street. Bloomberg analysts believe that Bitcoin is right now repeating the fate of her stock market.  The essence of the hedge fund is to make a profit on both the growing and falling markets, forcing these companies to constantly search for weak or repurchased securities to sell them.  GameStop (GME) stock was perfect for this role, and for 37 years the company owned a network of computer game disk stores. The leaders ""proclaimed"" the arrival of online video games by the manufacturers of the adjectives.  GameStop shuts down stores, and shares fell, coronavirus and locodowns finally lined up under the business, so speculators objectively sold stocks of GME until Wallstreetbets intervened.  They caught hedge funds selling GME futures, whose shoulder has the greatest loss of capital in loss. The Wall of Purchase forced speculators to record their losses, which in turn only increased growth. The GME course went up 1,500 percent, but the hedge funds were able to respond by negotiating with the leading brokers to close access to the stock purchases.  Bloomberg analysts warn that hedge funds have now chosen Bitcoin as their victim. According to the CME site, the number of BTC futures sold reached a maximum of $1.3 billion in history."

As previously noted by the South China Morning Post portal, the HKEx allocates 6 months to ensure that the application is admitted to closed hearings of the committee, which decides on its future status. If for the specified period the application before the hearing is not allowed, it is considered invalid.  Earlier it was reported that HKEx is in no hurry to give the green light to appeals from mining companies, doubting the viability of their business models. Last November, the application of a competitor from Bitmain, a mining company Canaan Creative, lost its validity.  If Bitmain decides to contact HKEx again, in accordance with the rules of the exchange, it will have to disclose financial statements for the third quarter of 2018, which the company until recently avoided, presumably due to large losses in this segment."

3142551,"The Uniswap community supported the launch of the third version of the decentralized exchange on the second level Arbitrum protocol. According to the founder, Uniswap Hayden Adams, the proposal received 41.35 million votes in favour and none against. His author noted that the abandonment of second-level networks, such as Arbitrum and Polygon, offered opportunities for competing exchanges to occupy this space.  ""We intend to support the community by launching smart contracts v3 in Arbitrum. We've already started working to support the interface and plan to deploy,"" Adams wrote.  He stressed that second-level decisions would bring ""unbelievable advantages"" from a user-to-user perspective, thanks to the rapid completion of transactions and the low commissions for processing them. However, he urged that the results not be expected too soon, as technology was experimental and still required extensive testing before it could maintain economic activity at a level comparable to the Ethereum's main block.  In 2019, Arbitrum raised $3.7 million to explore the possibility of scaling smart contracts, and in early 2020 launched their first rollup system on Ethereum. In November of the same year, developers reported that they were able to achieve a 55-fold reduction in the Uniswap v2 test with 390 asset exchange transactions per second, compared to seven Ethereum transactions.  Adams also noted that they were still planning to deploy Uniswap in the near future on the second-level Optimism network. The release was supposed to take place in May, but because of the closing of the last draft, it had to be postponed. Arbitrum intends to open its main network to developers on Friday. In March, the founder of Ethereum Vitalique Buterin praised Arbitrum for its progress in creating a second-tier solution compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), which allowed not only to translate ETH, but also to launch smart contracts."

One of them seems to be a video accountant, but my opinion of them you know, maybe they really like wax stripes (by the way, waxing was the worst thing in my life).  Another good example is the exemplary lucky women at the stoves who taste salad.  Here we go. Why is this happening? Most of the creatives and strategists in most advertising agencies are men with extremely stereotypical views of women and their joys. Most of these stereotypes have been produced by the girls themselves, but who is.  I remember very clearly one branstorm for a brand whose CA is 21+ girls. Most of the team was male and the goal of the campaign was to show the moments of pleasure.  The first thing the guys gave birth to is, ""Let her sit on a manicure!"" - that the small part of the women she was was shrivelled and said manicure wasn't a fucking pleasure. It's probably a day off or a day after work to go somewhere on an abstract warm camp when there's a lot to do at home. It's an hour to spend, an hour to sit there, an hour to drive back, a stranger to communicate, money to pay. What a pleasure!

One of the organizers of the conference is the Korean Friendship Association (KFA), an organization headquartered in Spain, working to establish international relations with the DPRK. The organization is recognized by the DPRK, unites its supporters in the world, cooperates with the authorities and receives official information from them.  According to KFA President, Spanish IT specialist Alejandro Cao de Benos de Les Peres, North Korean authorities have allowed citizens to own cryptocurrencies, and local developers are currently working on creating crypto wallets and “related applications”. Moreover, Cao de Benos made it clear that the country is in the process of creating a crypto exchange, although similar statements were made a year ago.  The blockchain and cryptocurrency conference will be held in the so-called Palace of Science and Technology in the DPRK capital from February 22 to 29, 2020. As the organizers promised, by its scale it will surpass a similar event in April this year. According to KFA, 100 foreign guests attended the April conference.  The organizers promise participants in the February summit the opportunity to meet with senior government officials and engineers. However, a conference ticket costs 3,400 euros - a fabulous price even by the standards of the decaying bourgeoisie - and participation is prohibited for citizens of South Korea, Japan, and Israel.

CME's new option is a futures contract for bitcoin launched by the same stock market in late 2017. One contract corresponds to five bitcoins and is centrally cleared on a trading platform, thus avoiding counter-party risks. In order to determine the course of the bitcoin, the CME uses data from several exchanges.  According to Skew's analysis firm, Bitcoin options have been in high demand since the beginning of the year – by Friday, the value of the bid exceeded $90 million. About 95% of Bitcoin options transactions last year took place at the Deribit Derivative Exchange. She recently announced that she would move the legal person operating the platform from the Netherlands to Panama. The reason was the entry into force of the EU Fifth Directive on countering money-laundering.  On Sunday, FTX also announced the launch of its own Bitcoin options.

BASEFEE is a cryptoeconomic analogue of the Central Bank's interest rates; it rises when the economy heats up and falls when the economy cools down. This increases the value of the balance sheet of the whole economic system.  Basically, BASEFEE is a regular ETH customer. - This is a ""buyback of shares"" of the company. “It's a central bank that levies interest rates to strengthen the currency.  With EIP1559 and the burning of BASEFEE, the supply of ETH is shrinking based on the growth of the Ethereum economy. This is a new paradigm created specifically for cryptoeconomics.  Ethereum researchers estimate that BASEFEE will burn 50-70% of current Ethereum fees (estimate from Ethereum core developers).  ▪️With Proof of Stake, the annual emission of ETH is less than 1% (the rate is ~ 25% ETH). ETH emission decreases from 4.75 million ETH per year (inflation of the monetary base 4.5%) to 0.5-1.2 million ETH per year (inflation of the monetary base ~ 0.5-1%).  ▪️With EIP1559, the annual ETH burn is 1.9%, it is estimated ~ 1M ETH will be burned in fees (at current fees markets, assuming that fees are burned by 60%).  ➕ What is the bottom line? The model of the transition to Proof of stake and EIP1559 can lead to a very serious increase in the price of Ether. And the end of December options, in which ETH ~ $ 25,000, no longer look strange"

The index consists of the DeFi sector in the form of DEX-birgues Uniswap, oracle network of ChinaLink, with ""traditional"" coins: Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Instead of the XRP, Bitwiise analysts introduced Stellar technology to avoid the risk of Ripple being defeated in court by SEC.

3142617,"Today, I, Katya of Luberetz, want to tell you not about the lipstick that's been pissed off, not about the carcass that you're gonna figure out without me, but about the diamond of your heart, which has recently glowed brightly in television. Meet Arena Virtukina. For me, Arena is the first sex blogger I've ever read, just to read, because she started to write before all of this. She started writing at 16 in Instagram, Arena was a columnist, Menx Health, since you were taking pictures of your coffee from the Starbucks (and about sex she started writing when the Starbucks wasn't even in Russia). That's where I found her in 2015. No tremors, no woman to like, clear, charismatic, with a killer sense of humor and energy. It's gonna be dumb, but it's got incredible power and charisma, which is rare. Then I found Arena already on the instagram, where she quickly grew up with readers, because she also wrote (and writes) about sex, testing sex toys, adding some normal living that we all have. And if she seemed to me in the magazine to be a distant, fictional girl (also because the avatar looked at me from a very confident charismatic conventionally beautiful girl who simply couldn't be real), then in the instagram, she was tickling like an arm and a seatper. And I realized that she's real, with problems, an ordinary man, not made up.  Hi, my name is Arena Vintokina, and I'm a polyamor. I have a lovely husband and a lovely girl. It's a quote from the Internet itself from Arena. Before her, all I read about polio was my friend Ani Saharova's material on polyamorical relations in the states. It seemed far away, untruthful and even in this America of yours. And here's the living girl, her husband, her girlfriend, and all three of them somehow live, find compromises, respect each other, communicate (or not!!! And they don't all live in a distant California, which many of us have seen in music videos, and somewhere on nearby subway stations.   The other day, I went to the TV and saw a message from Arena. I'm just having a heart attack because it's like someone from Cool Girl magazine wrote to you. She's alive, real, and she's reading my TV!!!!! And I am her!!!!!!!! And you read, love, regret, form, and know that it's all normal:   "

3142623,"  The Japan Financial Services Agency may soon prohibit local cryptobirts from conducting operations with Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH) anonymous cryptators. The regulator positions the potential prohibition as a precautionary measure to prevent money-laundering.  The list of crypts, which may be banned by Japan's regulator, does not end on the three coins in question and may then be expanded, at the expense of other currents actively used by the perpetrators, reports Forbes, referring to sources close to Japan's Financial Services Agency.  The reason for the ban on trade in Monero crypthalates (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH) is the ""mixing"" technology, which makes tracking of the sender and the recipient much more difficult. Europol had previously published a report that drew attention to the increasing popularity of Monero, Ethereum and Zcash in the criminal world, calling these coins the most dangerous.  The Regulator emphasizes that tracking the recipient and the addressee of the said crypts is almost impossible, which attracts fraudsters and criminals. However, in the case of the same Bitcoin regulators, it is possible to trace the movement of coins if such information is required."

3142697,"American bank analysts JPMorgan believe that Bitcoin is overrated and should cost about 13% cheaper, reporting to RBC Krypto with reference to Bloomberg Quint. In their view, too many investors are now holding long positions on the BTC, which is to say, playing a part in strengthening it.  However, some of these items were closed during the course adjustment period that began in September. Bitcoin went from $12,000 to $10,000 in a month, but then he played a part of the loss, and now it's $11,300.  Part of the reason for the strengthening of the BTC is the high interest of large companies and corporations. JPMorgan's analysts cited Square, a payment company based on Twitter creator Jack Dorsey, and Microsoft. Since August, they have invested $50 million and $450 million in the BTC, respectively.  However, many experts are of the view that Bitcoin is, on the contrary, undervalued. At the end of September, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone suggested that 1 BTC should cost approximately $15,000. The expert is confident that two factors are in favour of underestimation: an increase in the heshrate on the BTC network and an increasing number of users."

3142699,"  California's Digital Farms suspended its operations against the backdrop of a drop in the bitcoin price, written by CoinDesk.  On March 18, her parent company, DPW Holdings, provided updated information to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. Among other measures, she decided to close down her engineering unit.  ""The activities of Digital Farms in the production of Bitcoin have been stopped for an indefinite period, primarily because of the sharp decline in the Bitcoin market,"" she writes.  In May 2019, Digital Farms purchased 617,000 square feet of land to set up a mining company in the United States with ""direct access to 28 megawatts of electricity and an infrastructure capable of maintaining up to 300 megawatts"".  The company was formerly named Super Crypto Mining and was purchased by DAW in January 2018. To start a new business, she borrowed $5 million from two institutional investors and purchased a thousand Antminer S9 engineers. In the first year, DAW's mining revenue was $1.67 million. The firm intended to exploit the top 10 capitalizations and offer cloud engineering services.  The decline in global financial markets has forced DWP, like many other companies, to reprioritize, and the collapse of the Bitcoin price has made the decision quite obvious."

3142701,"This week, for the first time since mid-2018, the largest altcoin ether (ETH) has exceeded $400.  Glassnode researchers believe that the coin renews maximums, thanks to the increased activity of the users of the etherium network.  The number of daily transactional addresses now exceeds 482,000. This is the highest rate since the middle of last year, i.e. since the famous June ETH Rally.  Since January 2020, there has been a steady correlation between the growing number of active e-mail addresses and the prices of crypthalates, highlighted by analysts.  The correlation index between these two indicators is 60.9 per cent. Last year, it was over 76%. It has been found that if the number of active addresses on the airway increases by 1% per day, the altcoin values approximately 0.18% over the same period.  Today, the air is trading just below $400, and ETH rolled away as a result of a slight correction after its recent push. However, many analysts are confident that the potential for the resumption of the rally has not yet been exhausted.  Early this week, the CEO of the BitMEX Exchange, Arthur Hayes, Tweeted that the largest altcoin should, in the short term, break the annual record and exceed $500."

3142709,"Bakkt's crypto-derivative platform this Thursday announced the launch date of options contracts for its deliverable bitcoin futures. According to the announcement, the first regulated options for bitcoin futures will enter the market on December 9.  According to Kelly Loffler, CEO of Bakkt, the decision to launch a new product was made based on “customer reviews and aimed at hedging or gaining access to bitcoin, creating revenue and increasing efficiency in the context of costs and capital”.  “Bakkt's bitcoin futures options are another important step towards developing this asset class for institutional investors, as well as their clients and investors,” she added.  When working with futures, both parties are required to fulfill the terms of the contract, however, the option gives its buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset at a predetermined price at a certain point in the future. In this case, the option seller cannot refuse to fulfill the terms of the contract. He compensates for additional risks with the premium that the buyer gives him when concluding the contract.  According to Loeffler, ICE Futures US has used the self-certification of a new instrument to market it by the provisions of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  “We are committed to ensuring the trust and practical value of digital assets, and options contracts are an example of one of the many products we develop for regulated markets,” said CEO Bakkt.  Unlike Bakkt bitcoin futures, options contracts will allow platform clients to receive payments in traditional currency, which does not exclude the possibility of paying the cryptocurrency itself.  Loeffler also mentioned that on Wednesday Bakkt set a new record for the volume of trading in monthly bitcoin futures, amounting to about $ 4.8 million.  Earlier, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) reported its intention to launch bitcoin options."
3142710,"The Bitpapa Global P2P Marketplace announced the cancellation of commissions for all Bitcoin transactions until February 15. At that time, Bitpa users will be able to operate with cryptivate on the platform without paying any fees. The proposal covers the exchange, replenishment, transfer within the system, and withdrawal of funds for external wallets. For the latter, the service commission is 0.5% outside the current stock.  Buying bitcoin on Bitpapa for rubles is available through any popular exchange, including bank transfers (Sberbank, Tinkoff, Alpha Bank, etc.).), e-money (UMoney, QIWI), cash and maintenance of cellular operator balances. The minimum limit on the value of the transaction is $1.  There is no mandatory verification on the Bitpapa platform. Anonymous transactions and transactions without registration are also available to users. To buy Bitcoin quickly, the stock market launched Telegram bot. In addition, transactions can be entered into in iOS and Android applications or online versions of the platform, which are also available via Telegram. In case of questions about the operation of the exchange, the user may contact a 24-hour support service.  Every transaction on the Bitpapa is securely protected by a deposit system. This means that at the time of the transaction, the seller's cryptation is blocked in a special escro-account, which means that neither the seller nor the buyer has to worry about the security of the funds. In addition, Bitpapa uses a cold storage method. In other words, users first move into a hot storage facility, mix and then move to a cold storage facility with enhanced security.  After 15 February, a new commission will be presented, in which fees are determined by the activity and reputation of the user on the platform. The Bitpapa uses open pricing and there are no hidden commissions that collect some other exchanges, including them in the price of sellers."

In their view, the former &apos; s position as a class of assets had grown significantly.  The reduction of the May 2020 miner prize or the so-called halving will further increase the impact of bitcoin on the market. Weiss in the lead-up to the chalwing gave BTC the status of A- (excellent).  Researchers have stated that as the cut-off date approaches, the attraction of the largest digital currency will only increase.  As evidence of the growing popularity of Bitcoin, Internet users now have a massive interest in the theme of May Halving.  Arcane Research's analysts, referring to Google Trends' data, have recorded the largest increase in the interest of World Wide Web users in the topic since the reduction of the Miner Award in 2016. People are trying to figure out what halving is, and what the consequences are for bitcoin.  The first cryptoval started a new year with expansion, only after January did it add more than 30% to the cost. At the end of this week, the BTC is trading at $9,750. And in the futures market, the cryptation has already exceeded $10,000, and it seems like the same dynamic in the coming days we're going to be watching in the spot market."

3142730,"According to a document published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance, the regulator has started public consultations on the approval of the tokenization of shares in mutual funds. Comments are accepted before 1 October 2021.  The draft regulation, if adopted, would allow open-type investment funds to produce currentized shares using a blocker. The sponsors warned that the German financial industry might be at a disadvantage in the absence of appropriate regulation when other European jurisdictions resorted to currentization.  Token will represent a certain number of shares in a regulated fund. According to the authors of the proposal, currentization offers many advantages, such as reducing the entry barrier and reducing the administrative costs associated with new investors.  This initiative shows that block-chambers and cryptists are increasingly attracting the attention of legislators in one of the EU's richest countries. Germany has recently enacted a new Foundations Act (Fondsstandortgetz), which allows special funds to invest up to 20% of the money in bitcoin and ether. There are over 4,000 such funds. According to the experts, this law will bring the digital asset market in Germany to $657 billion."

3142733,"On Wednesday, the cryptoval community's attention was drawn to transactions of 0.55 ETH ($134), for which a commission of 10,668 ETH ($2.6 million) was paid. While users were talking about what might have caused such an abnormal movement of assets, another transaction was sent with the commission for the same amount.  According to Etherscan, the second transaction with the commission at 10,668 ETH from this address was sent today at 06:30 ICN. The amount of assets transferred this time in addition to the commission was more than 350 ETH.  The recipient was another address to which 0.012 ETH was also sent today from a confirmed OKEx account. In the first case, the assets received were immediately transferred to the Bithumb exchange.  Unlike the first transaction that was added to the Spark Pool pool block, the commission left Ethermine for the latter. ""We believe there has been a mistake. In order to solve this problem, the transaction sender must immediately contact us,"" Bitfly, the operator of Ethermine, wrote.  A second transaction of the same type did not help to clarify the situation. Some insist on the anti-money-laundering case: Miners report revenue according to awards and commissions received, so adding transactions with a large commission will avoid the need for the owner of the money to explain their origin. Others are confident that the program that runs this address will fail. Trucks are sent out every minute, which indicates at least a partial automation of the process.  The co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, after the first transaction, expressed confidence that an error had occurred, and advocated the early addition of the EIP 1559 protocol, which would reduce the role of manual input in the establishment of commissions."

In a Twitter report on Su Zhu, Su Zhu stressed that the current world economic situation could lead to a significant increase in the flow of money to Bitcoin, and thus to a significant increase in the first cryptivate.  ""Theoretically, this is the moment all bitcoin fans were waiting for. Several emerging economies are on the verge of default.

New times - new tools for market research. It's just a pity that statistics from centralized exchanges are in closed access.  We hope that Ethereum will be able to cope with the congestion of the network in the near future and redirect a large number of investors and traders to its decentralized exchanges, where all the figures for trading and the number of active users are publicly available."

CEO PayPal Daniel Schulman reported in early November that the client base of the service showed considerable interest in cryptivate-related opportunities, and the number of users on the waiting list exceeded his own expectations.  ""In the light of our clients' initial demand, we have also increased the weekly purchase limit from $10,000 to $20,000,"" adds PayPal.  For the first time, he announced his intention to open his clients to PayPal's cryptators in October. Schulman also reported that PayPal was negotiating with central banks and regulators to find new users who might be interested in digital currency wallets."

Up to 100,000 people, including 16,000 dealers in more than 200 countries, will have access to the system throughout the supply chain. The system supports three million different parts for 300 car models.  Blockchain is used to verify the originality of auto parts. The company is concerned that counterfeit parts are being used in some countries, which could lead to vehicle safety issues. Thanks to the blockchain, the car owner can scan the QR code on the packaging of auto parts and verify the authenticity of the part.  Another common problem is that repair companies charge full price for original parts, but use analogs instead. In this case, the parts do not provoke security problems, but the buyer does not receive what they paid for.  In addition to verifying the authenticity of parts, Hyundai envisions increased use of blockchain in the future throughout the entire vehicle service lifecycle. Insurers often pay for original parts, but are faced with the use of analogs. In the future, the original parts used will be linked to the vehicle's maintenance records.  When scanning the license plate in the repair shop, information about all the parts will be displayed. The repair firm will record the maintenance information in the vehicle history. The blockchain will allow this data to be transferred to the dealer, repair shop, insurer, manufacturer and owner. MAPS also uses machine learning to predict any delivery delays."

3142820,"  50-year-old Richard Hall and 28-year-old Lucash Jurashek filed a lawsuit against TRON Foundation and its founder, Justin San, accusing them of wrongfully dismissing them, against the background of objections to management practices and the application of the company's technology. Hall and Jurashek until last summer were employees of BitTorrent, a file exchange service acquired by TRON Foundation in 2018. The lawsuit was filed in October, but its details were not made public until last week.  According to the text of the 70-page document, San allowed Hall's degrading expressions to speed up the release of BitTorrent software. In another episode, Yurashek claims, San hit Kong Lee, the technical director who is also the defendant in the case, but never took responsibility for it. Lee, in turn, used force against a manager who had previously been insulted in person and in group discussions.  ""Lucash Jurashek saw two pairs of shoes through a crack under the door of the conference room,"" the plaintiffs wrote, meaning Lee and the manager. Then he heard a loud noise and, presumably, a sound of a blow or a slap with his hand."" After Lee opened the door to leave the premises, Jurašek saw that ""the manager's face was red and his eyes shiny."" The manager told Jurashek that Lee was setting ""unable to meet high technical standards"". Shortly thereafter, someone entered Yurashek's work account from another location and removed his e-mails.  In addition, Hall claims that it pointed out to the company's management the risks of third-party distribution of copyright-disrupting content and child pornography through BitTorrent, but failed to obtain a review of the lawyer's policy.  Lee also threatened Hall with dismissal if he took the already approved leave and demanded that he stay at work without seeking legal compensation. Hall disobeyed, and after returning, he was demoted and received a series of threats from Lee when he tried to record insults in his correspondence.  Hall and Jurashek were subsequently dismissed, as they themselves claimed, on discriminatory grounds, while Chinese employees were hired to work in China to violate American labour law, process and distribute illegal materials through BitTorrent. The plaintiffs intend to recover $15 million for damages and ask the court to facilitate compliance with the labour law by the defendants. TRON Foundation, BitTorrent, San and Lee responded to the claims in December, writing that they would not admit their guilt."

In response, HitBTC requested that illegal activities be reported to its support services and local law enforcement agencies.

HitBTC was founded in 2013 and has a very low level of transparency in its operations. Its management remains anonymous and requests for audits are ignored.

Akash DeCloud supports the automation technology for the deployment of Kubernetes applications and the Docker containerization system.

3142845,"Another project in the field of income farming based on the Polygon network stole its users. According to Rugdoc, the damage from Beetsfarm Finance was more than $100,000. Beetsfarm was positioned as the first Polygon farm to operate an automatic emission reduction mechanism.  Rugdoc claims to have stumbled upon Beetsfarm by using its scanner to select unverified contracts. The verification of the contract confirms that the compiled code corresponds to what was loaded in the lock-in.   Under pressure from the Beetsfarm community, however, the contract was later verified, ""but it still contained the highest number of alarms of all the examples we have seen"". Verification is not tantamount to an audit that has not been conducted in this case.  The Beetsfarm contract allowed anyone who wanted to move assets between the user's wallets and the project itself. In other words, once a contract was approved, the user allowed any outsider to transfer additional assets from his wallet to the project.  The project also had an immediate asset withdrawal function, which worked in a similar way but with one important difference. Instead of leaving the assets to the user's address, which matched the_wallet option, they were transferred to the ""wallet"" address, which marked the wallet of the project's creators themselves.  Although Beetsfarm was a minor project, the perpetrators managed to steal a large amount of money from users. This was facilitated by the unrestricted transfer of assets, which were then moved to their own wallet through the emergency withdrawal function.  As a result, Rugdoc recommends that users should not interact with unverified smart contracts and never allow transactions that they are not willing to trust in the project. Beetsfarm continues to engage clients on his Twitter by removing old messages that accuse them of fraud and posting new ones instead."
3142846,"Ethereum Classic was the victim of a double assault of 51% last week, resulting in a loss of about $7 million in double coins. Charles Hoskinson, who was working on the eTC fork code, offered help in the form of IOHK developers who almost completed the decentralization of Cardano.  The Director General of ETC Labs Terry Calver turned down their services, detailing the reasons for the decision, but the final word is left to the Etherum Classic community.  The problem lies in the context put forward by Charles Hoskinson, who demanded the establishment of a standing fund for funding from mining revenues. This would solve the issue of the payment of coders, but ""killed"" the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, according to Terry Calver.  Fifty-one percent of the attack occurred because of the low number of miners, and if you take 20 percent of the revenue from mining now, it will be even smaller. Once funds are received, it is necessary to address the issue of their distribution, which could lead to the centralization of the Etherum Classic ecosystem. Once funding is concentrated in one hand, grants will be awarded to the same projects by denying access to outside developers."

This is mentioned in the Block Genesis study, which notes that up to 85% of industry employees work in companies that are indirectly linked to cryptobirgic activities.  This applies to areas such as the maintenance of trade sites and engineering. Currently, there are 48 startups in the cryptospheric area, with a staff of 100. The largest employers in the industry are Huobi, Coinbase and OKEx.  Overall, up to 20,000 people are currently working in this area. Researchers have also found that only one third of companies are in American jurisdiction.  The majority of enterprises involved in the development of block-services and the provision of trade-related digital assets services have an Asian propiska. The Chinese company Bitmain is the largest employer in the mining industry.  The cryptosphere is becoming one of the highest-paid sectors of the economy.

But, let's be honest, before the final date when I can get on that list for six months, manager Forbes is still knocking. And I can give advice here.  The teeth and the tights are clear, let's go to the eyes.  Since spring, I've had a lot of Clarens brand products, and I don't understand one thing: why did you hide their cans from me???

The brand has a version of the Double serum cult serum, but for skin around its eyes.  I have a lot of experience testing the skin for anything, because genetics is about to be hard to understand, scarpe or raisins. And for me, it's not about aesthetics, it's about health and comfort.   The serum, when pumped, gives you a dose of pull-up gel and a drop of rejuvenating cream — one that needs to be mixed carefully with your fingers and applied slightly to the temple along the orbital bone — is the one that works in front of the eye when drawing the skull.  And like, if you've been rubbing leather around your eyes for a long time, too.  You don't have to do that, you have to go around the bone, and it's on its own.   Well, let's say they did. Next thing you know, the gel fills up small wrinkles, and the eyes are like this, and we live a better life.  I've been testing for two weeks, and if you use it twice a day, the wine at the store stops selling without a passport.   The boots are good. We should get them.

Survey respondents have more confidence in the digital currencies issued by the Central Bank than in decentralized currencies: 38 per cent of respondents do not trust decentralized cryptivates and 26 per cent believe in them. A quarter of the respondents responded that they did not know the question and 11 per cent did not have a certain opinion.  By comparison, the government was being cryptified in the survey, 54 percent said they would trust such an asset, and only 14 percent of the respondents would not trust them. Twenty-three per cent of the respondents expressed a ""balanced"" rating, and nine per cent were unaware of the crypthaluts at all.  "

3142878,"  On February 25, the OKEx Jumpstart platform will be the 10th primary stock market (IEO) with the aim of selling HyperDAO (HDAO) currents.  In total, HyperDAO intends to raise up to $2 million by selling 200 million of its currents. The sale will take place in two sessions, as in the last IEO on this exchange. The first is targeted at OKB holders, the second is targeted at users actively trading in the stock market. It is these indicators that will determine the distribution of allocations. For each session, 100 million HDAO is allocated. There is no limit on re-subscription in this case. The minimum investment is $320, the maximum bid for each round is $4,000.  HDAO is developing infrastructure for recently popular decentralized financial services (DeFI).  In the past, analysts have warned that IEO-Tokans tend to depreciate over time, making it most often meaningless to view them as long-term investments. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also issued a notice concerning the risk of such investments.  However, just recently at the Finance Launchpad IEO WazirX, participants still have good prospects for rapid capital turnover in some cases.

Bloomberg writes about it with reference to the bill.  The publication notes that German institutions like pension funds and insurers now manage ~ $2.1 trillion. So German ""smart money"" will be able to invest in cryptivates to $420 billion.  However, according to an expert from the German company, Tim Kreutzmann, the majority of the funds will not be in a hurry to invest. He said that the total investment in the cryptors ""at the initial stage"" would remain at a very low level of 20 per cent.  "

It will greatly benefit TRX/BTT/JST/WIN and the entire TRON community. New start! A new experiment! New adventure! It should be noted that Justin San has previously announced loud events. Other cases where he made loud statements and they were justified in the future included the integration of BTT into the BitTorrent and DLive ecosystems, the receipt of TRON of his own emodzi on Twitter, the acquisition of Poloniex and the successful sale of Juste currents, the launch of a decentralized JustSwap exchange and lunch with Warren Buffett.  Given the current cryptomatic euphoria around the DeFi sector, there is a good chance that it will affect the decentralized finance industry. This conclusion can be drawn from his statement that the new adventure will affect TRX, BTT, JST and WIN. The only likely way to win all four digital assets is through the use of a specific type of deFi platform. But now it's just a guess and a final word for Justin San."

At the same time, there has been an increase in the monopolization of the distribution of funds.  According to IntoTheBlock's analytical platform, a small number of wallets concentrated on their balance sheets the maximum number of Tether. The figures show that only 115 addresses control 56% of the total Tether supply.  Moreover, 9 whales hold 28.89% of the total Tether, while 106 large investors hold 27.11%.  Tether has 65.51 percent of the best rollers who keep coins for 1 to 12 months. Traders who keep a coin less than a month are 34.24 per cent.  The demand for stepples grew in response to increasing volatility, and traders also sought arbitration between issuers and secondary markets. As a result of the release of the most popular stylcoin, 1.6 billion Tether was released in April alone.  The world has accumulated dollars, and it turns out that the stepples have become one of the unbridled dollars that you can get outside the financial system,"" commented the co-founder of the cryptoval tracker Coin Metrics Nick Carter.  It is believed that the last short-lived bitcoin pamp, raising the price to $9,370, was caused by a large transfer of USDT by $50,015,000 to Binance.

The Philippines stock exchange closed indefinitely on Tuesday, and the currency and bond trade has been suspended. This is the first time that markets have stopped in the world against the backdrop of the spread of a deadly virus. The authorities explained their decision by taking care of the health of traders.  Previously, some other exchanges had also closed down trading sites or suspended tenders due to a large price collapse. However, the Philippines went further and imposed a total ban, which Reuters reported today.  Although the Filipino government refers to the epidemiological situation, analysts are confident that other exchanges can follow suit.  ""In view of the unprecedented rate of decline in stock prices, stock exchanges may close soon if the situation does not change,"" says the report of Capital Economics.  World markets are in a state of free decline, which has already reduced the total stock of shareholders by $14 trillion. Moreover, even traditional safe assets could not avoid falling because traders sold gold to cover losses in other markets.  The head of AdMacro's research group, Patrick Perre-Grin, had planned something similar during the weekend, that is, before the Philippines' decision became known. ""We've seen it before. I think we'll see about that again. Governments just don't need any more problems and stress right now.""  The Philippines' trade said that trade had been suspended until further notice ""to ensure the safety of workers and traders"" as part of the country's response to the epidemic.  Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance of the country, Rosalia de Leon, cited isolation as the reason for the suspension of the sale of fixed-income securities. The currency will resume on 18 March.  In Malaysia, where isolation had also been introduced since 18 March, the securities regulator had stated that all capital markets would operate normally.  CME Group Inc closed its trading site in Chicago last week to avoid a crowd of people; Middle East exchanges have taken similar measures, although electronic commerce remains available."

Under the terms of the agreement, Kik is required to pay $5 million in fines for organizing an illegal ICO campaign, during which he managed to raise $100 million to develop his cryptotive project, Kin.  The judge previously supported the position of SEC in this case. It will now also have to approve the proposal of the parties to the proceedings.  SEC sued Kik in May 2019. The regulator claimed that ICO Kin was an illegal sale of securities because it was not registered. Kik, for his part, promised to defeat SEC in court, thus protecting the interests of the entire cryptocular industry. The lengthy litigation with the regulator, however, proved to be too costly. The company subsequently reduced 80 per cent of its employees and set up a $5 million fund to protect the Kryptostartup interests of SEC victims.  Also under the terms of the future agreement, Kik is required to notify SEC of his intentions in 45 days if he is going to perform any operations with reserves in the Kin vault.

3142968,"  Former U.S. presidential candidate and well-known supporter of Andrew Young have announced the launch of a new project to protect data privacy online.  Yang left the presidential battle in mid-February, and now decided to start a new non-profit organization called Humanity Forward. The organization's activities will focus on the ""census of rules"" of the economy and society, with a focus on data confidentiality.  Young said that his organization would build a people-centred America, and he now called for donations to support the new organization. Young had previously accepted donations for his presidential campaign in cryptovals, but Humanity Forward has yet to accept cryptomoneths.  The main principle of the new organization is ""Done as a right of ownership"". The Humanity Forward movement is inspired by Andrew Young's 2020 presidential campaign and includes such basic aspects as guaranteed basic income (UBI); human-centred capitalism; and ""data as ownership"".  The new non-profit organization calls for the confidentiality of these citizens from the point of view of fundamental human rights. Humanity Forward opposes online platforms that collect data from their users and sell them to advertisers or fraudsters. Humanity Forward also urges people to fight for privacy.  Humanity Forward emphasizes that some states have already enacted new laws to enable consumers to control their rights to personal data. The new organization intends to force companies to comply with their obligations under these laws in such a way that it is the consumers who benefit from the use of personal data."

Decentralized financing or DeFi refers to blocked services, including borrowing, investment and trade, outside the banking system. Many applications work on the Ethereum network and use their own ETH, the price of which has risen by about 540% above $4,800 this year.  In dollar terms, DeFi's growth on the Ethereum block this year exceeded 780 percent, mainly due to the increase in the price of the ether, according to a study by the JPMorgan team led by Nikolaos Panigirzoglu. According to them, an analysis of the volume of Ether currents blocked in DeFi indicates a slower but steady increase of 50% in 2021.  "

Now shampoo, cheap, like your broken life plans and your business lunch, though you're still not a business.  I love Ashan. It's the only place you can feel even more fucked up than a rainy morning with Maculatura in your headphones. Ashan is the smell of old age, useless fuss, turns, shares in rice, and the end of your youth.  And Ashan, they're reckless shopping. 'Cause where, like here, you put garden supplies, pantyhose, machines, sausage and a toy chopper in the basket. This time in Ashan, I was once again tricked by Agatha's grandmother. After changing a number of products, these gentlemen came to their CA when they wanted to be cheaper, but to make their eyes happy. The clever Agatha gave me shampoo. She met me and handed him, ""Hey, hey, look at the volume of 129 rubles."" I looked at this bag, I looked at the price tag, and now we're standing by the register.  By the way, shampoo's good. His smell reminds me of the summer morning in the village. He's as good as you when you find out the guy spent all his money in the house again. There's one thing that's really wrong with packing.

It will be recalled that in September 2017, Kik made the initial placement of tokens (ICO), after which the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that ICO Kik had attempted to remedy his financial situation by violating securities laws. Last month, the Commission called on the court to expedite the Kik case, owing to the absence of specific arguments as to why KIN currents were not registered as securities.  In its memorandum, the Blackchain Association argues that the court must first determine whether ICO Kik can be regarded as an accredited investor and the open sale of currents as a ""integrated"" sale of securities. The Association asked the court to refrain from applying the approach taken in the Telegram case.  "

Spania is now in detention without bail.   The arrest was made at the request of the Government of South Africa, which is seeking the extradition of Spania on charges of fraud. These charges are not related to Monero, but are related to his previous position as information technology manager at Cape Cokeys.  As an employee of Cape Cookies, Spania intercepted accounts from another company, Ensync, concerning the information technology goods and services it provided to Cape Cookies. According to the prosecution, Spania knowingly used false information to compile false invoices from Ensync using the company &apos; s details, including the VAT payer &apos; s number and bank account information.   Spanya then raised the prices of the company &apos; s goods and services, making illegal profits.

Also from the market environment, DETO-USDT will offer spot trading. DETO is its own Delta current, which is launched tomorrow. Delta stated that it would also be ""too soon"" to offer spot markets for bitcoin and others to cry.  When asked why Delta needed its own current, Balani said that DETO would play a central role in the growth of Delta and its ecosystem. ""In the recent past, the DeFi platform has demonstrated how the democratization of market relations can provide enormous liquidity. So we're moving this idea to centralized derivatives of financial instruments,"" said Balani. ""DETO will be given as an incentive to ensure the liquidity of Delta liquidity pools.""  DETO is also a service current, said Balani, and that it can be used to pay for the stock market commissions and will be allowed as collateral for Delta as soon as the ""stable price"" for DETO becomes available.  At present, Delta has 35 employees, and the stock market ""aggressively adds"" new people to its engineering and marketing teams, Balani said.  According to Balani, the private sale of currents brought the total funding of Delta to almost $7 million. Previously, the exchange attracted about $2 million for two rounds in 2018 and 2020."

3143000,"According to updated data, together with the founder of OKEx, Minsuei Xi (Star Sea), Hong Kong police arrested two other high-ranking stock exchange executives. The insiders indicate that their candidatures were not random, both had access to secret keys and were released on bail, with the condition that they were handed over to the law enforcement authorities.  The Chinese authorities now have total control of about 200,000 BTCs on the OKEx cold wallets, which is about 1.1 per cent of the total Bitcoin.  The Exchange cannot specify the exact time for restoring the withdrawal of clients' funds, as law enforcement officers are busy checking purse addresses for transactions with a cryptated land in the Mainland of the PRC. This is the main reason for Star Sea's arrest, but the warrant was based on an OK Group scam that recaptured the public company LEAP Holdings Group Ltd, whose shares are traded on the Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX).  OKEx would never have passed the HKEX listing, which led Star Sea to initiate the LEAP buy-in procedure. The construction company was selected because of the distress, after the loss of 80 per cent of capitalization in the second half of 2018."

3143006,"Cybercriminals abandon extortion programmes in favour of more hidden methods of stealing money and seizing valuable computing resources. This is evidenced by the report of the world's leader on cyber security solutions, Trend Micro Incorporated.  The document states that during the first half of 2018, the company recorded a 96 per cent increase in the number of unauthorized cryptominig detections compared to the entire year 2017 and a 956 per cent increase compared to the first half of 2017.  ""Statistical, non-directive attacks using extortion programs, as well as data theft, became the norm, so the attackers changed tactics to act more covertly. It follows that business leaders must evaluate their resources to provide sufficient protection to deal with new and serious cyber threats,"" noted the Director of International Communications on Threat Issues, Trends Microsoft, John Clay.  Another important trend in the first half of the year is the proliferation of unusual types of harmful software, such as non-physical, macro- and micro-filtrous harmful software.  In particular, Trend Micro recorded a 250 per cent increase in the detection of the TinyPOS microfilm as compared to the second half of 2017. This may be due to an increase in the ability of these types of harmful programmes to bypass safety devices that use only one protection mechanism.  In addition, 15 large-scale data leaks were recorded in the first half of 2018, resulting in the theft of more than a million records. Almost half of the leaks resulted from unintentional data disclosure, with most leaks occurring in the health sector."

The plan, although currently merely a proposal, represents a final effort to issue debt obligations by the bitcoin companies in North America, which are looking for money to pay for costs and expand equipment.  It also happened only a month after Marathon announced that it had received a revolving credit line of $100 million from Silvergate Bank, provided by its BTC and United States dollars.  Publicly registered North American bitcoin mining companies, such as Marathon, Riot, Bitfarms, Hut8 and Argo, have all adopted the ""walking"" strategy of almost all the bitcoins they have produced since the beginning of the year, instead of eliminating them for capital spending.  The Block previously reported that as of the third quarter, only six large bitcoin companies in North America alone held more than 20,000 BTCs, which at that time stood at $1 billion. And they continued to add their October monthly output to the balance sheet.

3143064,"  Thirty-five foreign companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, Mastercard, Sony, Intel, and Walmart, submitted 212 applications for registration of inventions, with reference to the blocker in China. As of the end of March 2020, the local English-language edition of Global Times is available.  Mastercard submitted 46 patent applications, thus exceeding other foreign companies. Most of the patents it registers relate to payment methods, payment software and payment security. The company began to apply for patent applications in 2017.  Nokia applied for 13 patents, Intel for 12, Oracle for 9. Some of them explain the fact that applications are submitted in an effort to accumulate and register a vast technological base. At the same time, none of these companies opened a blockage business in China. This is interesting because patents in China, regardless of the subject matter chosen, are usually registered by foreign firms in their intention to develop on the local market.  IBM, Google, Facebook, and Amazon are also active developers of blocking technology solutions, but have not applied for patents in China."
3143065,"Vitalik Buterin called on legislators to be more open to block-chamber protocols, saying that they could help government authorities fight monopoly and anti-competitive behaviour.  The co-founder of the Efirium, together with a competition expert and a research fellow at the University of Harvard, Tibo Schrepel, published an article entitled ""The Code of Blocking as an Antimonopoly Instrument"", which focuses on the possibilities of a blocker to assist competition authorities.   Buterin and Shrepel argue that blockches and anti-monopoly services ""have a common purpose"" in preventing the apparent centralization of economic power. According to them, anti-monopoly agencies promoted decentralization by punishing anti-competitive behaviour, such as a blockage led by decentralization.  The authors noted that ensuring the prosperity of the blockade would benefit the competition authorities. Since anyone can make transactions in a lock house regardless of location, technology can provide more equitable conditions in jurisdictions where competition law does not exist or is not effective enough.  The article argues that in the short term, the competition agencies of the U.S. Fair Trade Commission (FTC) should support the development of technology. For example, establish regulatory sandboxes for block companies, where they can develop and operate under a weakened regulatory oversight and with fewer regulations.  Snapel clarified that such initiatives could include a reduction in the supervision of ""anticompetitive block-chamber applications developed in a highly decentralized manner"" and ""not too stringent a regulation of these blocks"". In the long term, competition authorities can help to create a new regulatory framework and promote regulatory sandboxes."

3143119,"  Macroinvestor Paul Tudor Jones decided to buy bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, which he fears as a result of central bank printing policies. Jones told his clients that Bitcoin could play the same role as gold in the 1970s. Bloomberg writes about it.  ""The best strategy to make the most profit is to hold the fastest horse,"" Jones said. ""If I had to predict, I'd bet on bitcoin.""  In doing so, he specified that his Tudor BVI fund could mark ""the percentage at the bottom of the single number range in the bitcoin futures"".  Jones's condition is estimated at $5.1 billion. He was famous for his ability to predict ""black"" Mondays and Tuesdays, particularly the ""black Monday"" of 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Index fell the most.  The investor reported that he had decided to look at the bitcoin after assessing the impact of fiscal policies in the major countries of the world and the purchase of bonds by central banks against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. He estimates that $3.9 trillion worth of money has been released since February, corresponding to 6.6 per cent of the world economy's productivity.  "" Developments in the world arena are developing so fast that even veterans like me have lost their voice, "" said Jones. ""We are witnessing great monetary inflation – an unprecedented expansion of all forms of money that developed countries have never seen before.""  Jones admitted to considering various hedging options against inflation, such as gold, U.S. government bonds, some stocks, currencies, and stock exchanges. He first invested in Bitcoin in 2017, doubling the amount before leaving the position at a maximum of about $20,000. This time, in assessing bitcoin, he relied on its characteristics as a means of accumulation and rated the cryptation on four parameters: purchasing power, trust, liquidity, and mobility.  ""I don't chase hard money or cryptuts,"" he wrote. – The most convincing argument for Bitcoin ownership was the upcoming worldwide digitization of currencies, the accelerated COVID-19."""

He added that if cryptized as a commodity or a digital asset could be consistent with the principles of the Shariah and could demonstrate a clear benefit, it could be traded.  The National Ulema Council is responsible for the observance of the Shariah in the country where the largest number of Muslims live.

It is known that sanctions have begun to be applied to the ByBit, Polonix and Kucoin platforms. The regulator accuses these trading sites of violating Canadian securities law.  The refusal to service traders from Canadian province indicates that Binance does not want to register its subsidiary structure with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

3143128,"It smelled September on the street today. There's a day like this in August when you go outside and you know it's autumn. It's not on the calendar, it's nothing special, you just come out and feel it. The first yellow leaves, the cool seamstress and the smell, the smell of you and your mom going to the market to buy the most beautiful diary and a backpack with the Mermaid.  It doesn't seem to be much of a September now, but it's getting cold, you know, you put on a gray sweater and a warm coat, you take your coffee with you and warm your hands on a glass. September used to be a part of a new life-- who changed over the holidays, who was where, so much to listen to, so much to tell.  Every summer I sold books at the market and helped my mom at her dots. Work wasn't easy-- heat, heavy boxes, dust. So I could read whatever I wanted and buy myself some first-class stuff like a giant green bag or a varnish shoe on a first shotgun.  Every year at the end of August, I went to the local RivGosh and bought the first perfume, the first self-contained perfume, each time different, for a very long time, and carefully chosen and pretended, and did I have enough? Wouldn't you like it?  I remember every single one of these cans, every bottle, every smell of Escade mixed with an apple pussy. It's the smell of very young years.  I collected nostalgic fragrances at discounts (this, as you may have noticed, is not a promotion post, so I looked where I had to) so that you could also remember these dark summers of 2008, 2009. It's already cheap perfume, but then it meant more than just a bottle.  Red "
3143129,"CEO of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange questioned the prospects for IPO mining companies  The head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has confirmed that specializing in mining cryptocurrency companies can in vain expect to hold an initial public offering (IPO) on its site. This writes CoinDesk, citing local media.  According to their information, HKEX CEO Charles Li Xiaojia said that companies wishing to issue their securities on HKEX should have a “sustainable” business model. Although Lee did not mention specific names, he gave his comment on the requirements for listing in response to a question about the prospects for miners. To date, three major Chinese mining companies - Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang - have applied for an IPO on HKEX, but none of them have received any approval.  According to Lee, a company that earned billions of dollars in one area and then suddenly switched to another direction, refusing to disclose information about its results at a certain interval in the past, demonstrates that its business was “unsustainable” in the first case.  The next question HKEX asks such companies is their ability to continue doing business and make money. The exchange will ""adhere to the principle of market adaptability"" when considering applications for IPO, including those that were issued by cryptocurrency miners, Lee added.  Bitmain filed an application for an IPO in September last year, and Canaan and Ebang - in May and June, respectively. Later, a source familiar with the situation said that HKEX is not in a hurry to approve these applications due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market."

According to the results of the analysis, the fourth quarter turned out to be the most painful for cryptocurrency funds for the entire period of research. The median loss on this segment was 18.8% versus 9.2% in the third quarter and 4.3% in the second. Relative to Bitcoin, however, hedge fund assets grew by about 25%, and against Bitwise 10 Large Cap - by 27%.  "
3143133,"  The asset manager of Bitwise Associate Management intends to provide retail investors with access to its index fund, ""Bitwise 10 Index Fund"".  In the foreseeable future, the company will seek to add it to the OTC Markets (OTCQX) alternative trading system supervised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If so, securities based on major crypts will be available for the first time to clients of brokering services such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade.  On Friday, Bitwise notified the investors of her plans. It must now ensure public disclosure in accordance with the requirements of alternative trading systems and register as a marketmaker with the Financial Services Regulatory Service (FINRA).  ""We expect to obtain a trade permit in the second half of 2020. It's gonna take months to start the bidding,"" CEO Bitwise Hunter Horsley said.  He also noted that Grayscale Investments had to undergo a similar procedure, with cryptoval trusts already listed on OTCQX. Like one of Grayscale's trusts, Bitwise 10 uses a diversified basket of assets. It includes crypthalates representing 85% of market capitalization, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Litecoin, EOS, Tezos, Stillar Lumens, Cardano and Ethereum Classic.  According to Horsley, interest in such products continues to grow. According to the Bitwise survey, 72 per cent of consultants receive job requests from their clients with cryptivates. Some 6 per cent have already invested in digital assets and their share is expected to double by the end of the year.  Horsley claims that the current economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic do not pose a particular threat to his company's business, but acknowledges that ""everything can happen in time of panic.""  He confirmed that Bitwise did not abandon the Bitcoin-ETF plan. ""We are continuing work on Bitcoin-ETF. The index fund will coexist with potential Bitcoin-ETF as an alternative option,"" he said."

3143151,"Currently, British regulators are looking at the prospects for the release of a digital asset.  The Chief Economist of the Bank of England, Andrew Holdane, believes that digital currencies, including the digital currencies of central banks (CBDC), can destroy the traditional business model of financial institutions. This view was shared by the banker during his presentation in anticipation of dismissal after 30 years of service.  According to Andrew Holdane, a digital currency can change banking at a fundamental level. The banker is confident that new instruments can destroy the traditional model of financial institutions, which has been operating for over 800 years.  He believed that digital assets could lead to a fragmentation of the banking business. In particular, he believed that the market would be open to narrow-minded units of credit organizations for certain types of transactions.  Remember, British regulators, like many other supervisory authorities around the world, are in the process of developing the CBDC and exploring the possibility of launching a digital version of the national currency.  The final decision as to whether a financial instrument would be available in Britain has not yet been made. Before the verdict comes, the local authorities want to weigh the pros and cons. According to Andrew Holdane, the Bank of England takes about a year to study the issue.  The decision to develop the CBDC was taken against the background of the growing popularity of electronic payments in the region. British regulators also pointed out that the release of the instrument might be necessary, against the background of the active development of digital versions of national currencies in other countries.  While the Bank of England is wondering if the country needs a CBDC, Russian regulators have already selected financial organizations to test the digital ruble, which is due to start in 2022."

3143158,"Despite the fact that many of the leading DeFi-protocols on the Ethereum base record weekly losses, the success of the Binance Smart Chan (BSC) pushes the amount of funds involved in the DeFi to a new record peak.  According to DeFi Llama's data aggregate, DeFi's protocols now have almost $79 billion blocked. This amount is about twice the market capitalization of the Binance Coin (BNB), which ranks third-line digital currency rating, and represents almost one third of the market capitalization of the second crypthalate (ETH) rating.  Most of the increase in frozen funds over the past week has been on several large platforms, and only three of the 10 largest protocols in the DeFi sector have shown growth.  Decentralized BSC applications continue to lead in this sector, and the fourth-ranked PancakeSwap protocol grew by 29% or $1.3 billion last week. The Ellipsis Finance Protocol also attracted a significant amount of funds — $1.9 billion — and ranked thirteenth in the volume of frozen funds less than a week after launch.  Over the last seven years, the total amount of funds frozen in the DeFi protocols has increased by about 10 per cent and continues to rise despite the depression of most of the leading decentralized Etherum-based financial platforms."

It stated that banks associated with cryptovalytes should have reserve capital corresponding to the degree of risk. According to the initial consultative document, a banking organization investing in cryptivates $1,000 must have a reserve capital of $1,000.  Some of the world's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, opposed this requirement, calling it ""excessly conservative"" and claiming that it could prevent banks from participating in trading in the market.

3143215,"Last week I was on vacation and at sea. Both of these things are already ""beyond three years ago,"" and the clerks will understand the feeling when you're back, but it's been a long time.  There's going to be a story about dementia, courage and love that I brought with me from 2009.  No, it's not eyelashes, it's not French on your fingernails, it's not passions on a Jusie Couture costume. That's ZAGAR. When I write about the fact that I was thrown into my parents' hands by the gypsies, there's some truth to it: I have a very dark father, too. That's why genetics makes me light up instantly and never burn on the beach.   From vacation, I usually bring sand with me in a bathing suit, a less human face, a local meal, and a VERY ZAGAR born from the mtv when the Hilton penis was still nothing.  For eight years now, I know one Jesus'oil, which is blacking out on the first night of the sea, even if you flew into the rain after sunset. Ask me what's in there for spf, I'll tell you he's in MINUS. Is it good? No, it's disgusting, it's harmful and it's bad, but I'm giving my head a cut, which is 50 percent, which is nothing at all on the beach, or if it's masculine. It's your business. At least light it up, and I'm not much of a preacher either.  Short, this time I was flying with my backpack, I didn't take any butter, I thought I'd buy it on the spot, I'd eat garrier everywhere, I'd have a chick grill in a week. What do you think? Of course, there was no butter in one magazine of Kipra!!! I had to take it from the same line, but it's shorter than the rapper guy and the rock band guy -- it doesn't make any comparison. Is it on fire? Nope. Are you upset? That's right.  Your bro's an Ambre tanner in a big dark bottle, and the rest aren't bros.  But if you're smarter than me, spf is cool and important, don't forget him!"
3143216,"After the first announcement in February this year, the OKEx kryptobir finally integrated the Bitcoin Lightning network.  OKEx users can now use the solution to scale level 2 bitcoin Lightning Network to perform deposits and withdrawals. This function is now available on the OPEx desktop version as well as on mobile devices.  Lightning Network will reduce the average cost of bitcoin transactions below 0.01 cents, as reported by Director General OKEx Jay Hao. In addition, the average time for confirmation of transactions will be reduced to 1 to 3 seconds.  Although Lightning Network offers value and speed advantages, there are also certain limitations. The network is primarily designed for small transactions, so OKEx will limit transactions to 0.05 BTC (currently around $2830).  Lightning was launched in 2018. It currently supports a number of cryptobears, including OKCoin, Bitfinex and Bitstamp. This year, Kraken also announced her plans to integrate the network."
3143217,"The organization had previously worked on the development of an infrastructure for a financial instrument.  A large Chinese company, JD com, is a rival to the digital renminbi (e-CNY) company called Alibaba. TechCrunch writes about it.  According to the media, the platform has begun to pay salaries in the digital renminbi only to some of its employees. Which of the company's specialists will receive the e-CNY payments is not specified.  The selection by the Chinese authorities of JD com, as a partner for the creation of a financial instrument, is notable for the company's position in the PRC market. The fact is that the organization is a direct rival to another giant of electronic commerce, Alibaba, owned by a popular payment system called Alipay. The latter, along with WeChat Pay, accounts for about 98% of China's mobile payment market.   Recently, Chinese regulators, despite early claims that the digital renminbi would not compete with popular payment systems in the PRC, launched a financial instrument PR. Active e-CNY advertising can harm the monopoly of Alipay and WeChat Pay.  Despite the fact that the digital renminbi has not yet been officially launched, the major banks of the PRC have already been collecting applications for the activation of wallets for the financial instrument. According to recent data, e-CNY will be widely used during the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. It is during this period, according to the regulators, that the digital renminbi will be made available to foreigners."

3143221,"The early investor and Bitcoin supporter Max Kaiser is not concerned about the recent collapse of the cryptocular market. An analyst is confident that Bitcoin Kaiser's rate will grow and that massive money emissions and new signs of inflation will force companies to buy BTCs more and more this year. He predicts that corporations will be involved in large-scale purchases of bitcoin, and by the end of 2021, this stunt will increase the rate by 500 per cent.  "
3143222,"The reverse side of bullrun  The latest data from The Block conveys another argument for the hype in the market. The numbers show that Coinbase's mobile app ratings have moved the platform to the top 50 on both GooglePlay and AppStore.  At the beginning of October, the exchange app was in the region of 600 and above positions.  The exchange's traffic is also hitting annual records and has roughly doubled to nearly 50 million visits in December. The exchange is preparing a good portfolio for an IPO.  By the way, Binance is even slightly ahead of the American exchange in this regard and has increased traffic by 50% from October to 56 million visits.  The only drawback to all this popularity is that exchanges cannot withstand high loads during times of high volatility. And high traffic and trading interest will actually turn off the exchanges in the most active moments.  Perhaps with an IPO, at least Coinbase will be able to solve this problem, because the level of hype, although high, has not yet reached 2017."

3143232,"  CoinMetrics developed CMBI Bitcoin Hash Rate Index and Observed Work, which will provide a more relevant, accurate and manoeuvrable picture of hashrate than traditional ways of measuring it.  The companies expect that the developed metrics will be recognized and will form the basis for the creation of derivatives that will allow the Meyers to hedge their risks.  CoinMetrics believes that current hashrate valuation methods are not without shortcomings and do not allow such challenges to be successfully achieved.  Experts note that they are now in a position to make maximum internal calculations of the complexity of engineering and to assess the frequency at which blocks are produced.  "
3143233,"The world's largest investment company, BlackRock, is studying cryptivates from the point of view of their suitability for hedging market cycles. It was announced by CEO BlackRock Larry Fink, written by Reuters.  In response to a question from a visitor to the annual stockholders' meeting about whether BlackRock was going to invest in crypthalates, Fink stated: ""The firm is monitoring the development of cryptos. We're looking at what that means, infrastructure, regulatory space.""  At the same time, he stressed that BlackRock, which manages $9 trillion in assets, has long-term investment strategies. In the meantime, the crypts represented ""just a tool for speculative trade"", he noted. Fink also stated that dealers who benefit from high market volatility and broad price spreads earn the most on digital assets.  In April, BlackRock discovered the first investments in cryptivates. The firm purchased 37 futures contracts for Bitcoin of the Chicago Commodity Exchange with a nominal value of $6.1 million. In February, BlackRock's investment director, Rick Reeder, announced that they were ""slightly involved"" in cryptovals, but refused to go into detail. ""I feel that technology and regulation have evolved to a point where many begin to see it as part of the portfolio, and it moves the price up,"" he said."

3143237,"According to ABC News, the operation revealed a complex terrorist financing scheme organized by two French extremists who have been residing in north-west Syria since 2013. 29 persons between the ages of 22 and 66 who have been arrested for interrogation throughout France are suspected of financing terrorist activities under a carefully thought-out scheme.  Most of them are suspected of investing in the terrorist financing network. According to the police, two of them played a key role in the cyber-finance system. The scheme was discovered by a group of the French Ministry of Economy, Tracfin, which monitors financial fraud, money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. According to the group, the network used crypthaluts.  Hundreds of thousands of euros are believed to have been handed over through the network to members of al-Qa'idah and the illegal terrorist organization ISIL in Russia. According to the publication, members of the network in France purchased cryptoval coupons and handed over their details by means of safe messages to terrorists in Syria.  The French Public Prosecutor &apos; s Office specified that many people in France regularly bought coupons worth between 10 and 150 euros, which were credited to accounts available to terrorists abroad and then the cryptos were released through cryptocular exchanges. The French authorities opened an investigation in January when Tracfin discovered the financial network."

It also helps to avoid slippage - a transaction of several million dollars on the stock exchange can seriously increase the price of bitcoin, and large investors would eventually pay much more than originally thought. This type of trading is primarily designed to attract large players to the market, who intend to invest in solid currency amounts in a solid amount.  "

3143246,"According to the Uphold investment platform, Bitcoin is smaller than the Ripple XRP by volume of transactions in the UK.  Data from the Uphold investment platform show that transactions in the UK for all cryptivates increased 16 times in the first three months of 2021. However, the most interesting data twist shows that the volume of Ripple XRP transactions is at least eight times the volume of Bitcoin transactions.  It is clear that the huge increase in the volume of XRP reflects the volatility of the current price in relation to the SEC RIPple complaint. XRP changed from a minimum of $0.21 to a maximum of $1.91 in 2021.  Uphold continued listing the Ripple XRP despite a complaint by SEC. According to the representatives of the investment platform, there was no court decision and therefore no change in U.S. law.   Uphold serves almost six million customers in more than 150 countries. The number of Uphold users from the United Kingdom has increased by 500 per cent over the past 12 months, with an average of 15,000 new customers per month in 2021, compared to about 2,500 in 2020."

This is due to an increase in the mood sub-index and a slight increase in the health metrics of the network. The latter was influenced by the increase in the number of active participants and the accession of new members of the block. Investors &apos; attitudes had declined over the previous two weeks, but the negative momentum had been disrupted in the past week, primarily because of the increased tendency of investors to retain crypthalates.  Liquidity fell by six points. This effect was caused by the fall in stock deposits and transactions on the block office.

3143268,"The non-castodial exchange is cryptic to IDEX for $2.5 million in a round of seed funding to restart the trading platform. It was attended by G1 ventures, Borderless Capital, Collider Ventures and Gnosis.  The funding received will be used to further develop the product, market and expand the user base. According to the developers, IDEX 2.0 will link the productivity of a centralized exchange to the security of a decentralized exchange.  The developers intend to adapt the stock exchange infrastructure to enable marketmakers to use it effectively through their own software and strategies. Previously, liquidity had been one of the main obstacles to attracting users.  In addition, the exchange promises to provide low delays in the execution of applications and support for advanced types of warrants, as well as to implement a matching engine capable of handling hundreds of thousands of requests per second.  A new version of the platform has been under development since January 2019. Her release is scheduled for next month.  The area of decentralized exchanges has been cryptified recently by the interest of traders. In July, for the first time, the total bid volume at such sites exceeded $4 billion. The leader is Uniswap with 41% shares, followed by Curve and IDEX.  IDEX hopes to gain a competitive advantage over Uniswap and other platforms that use automated marketing systems but do not support requisition books. According to developers, this approach is highly inefficient for ordinary marketmakers, while the experience with IDEX 2.0 in this context will be close to centralized exchanges."
3143269,"The Nvidia video card manufacturer allows the re-production of specialized graphic chips (GPU) aimed at mining to be cryptized. The executive vice president and financial director of Colette Cress announced this.  According to her, if demand rises to the ""significant"" level, Nvidia can again produce a CMP – GPU with remote video drives, thereby reducing their cost. At present, RTX 30 series video cards are popular among the engineers, but, according to Kress, companies no longer regard cryptating as an important part of their business.  ""The demand from gamers is very high, and we think it exceeds our current offer,"" she added.  The resumption of the CMP is expected to release video cards for gamers. During the current rally, there was again a lack of video cards in the market, as was the case in 2017-2018.  Nvidia, however, remains the figure of a claim by investors who accuse the company of distorting the role of sales of the equipment to the Miners in its business. ""The manual knew that the sales increased due to the demand for crypts were not sustainable because the demand for cryptivates was volatilen,"" the plaintiffs argued."

Beam management reported that the hardfork would take place on block 777,777. The new algorithm will be aimed at supporting anonymous assets, unilateral payments, and the activation of the Lelantus Mimblewimble protocol for highly confidential transactions. In addition, BeamHash III will maximize the power of the GPU.  Counselor Beam Guy Corem informed users that the test version of the hard fork would be available a few weeks before the main network launch, depending on the time the blocks were generated. Beam plans to release the binary files Node and Desktop Wallet by the end of May. As early as possible, Eger Electronic 5.0 will be available to automatically switch to BeamHash III when the corresponding height of 777777 is reached, so that the hardfork will pass ""in painless"" for the engineers.

3143285,"  Further consideration of a claim for potential violation of securities law by the United States Fantas-Ripple company is admissible. That was the decision of the Northern California District District District Judge, Phyllis Hamilton, on Wednesday.  Hamilton ruled that the organizers of the group action accusing Ripple of illegal distribution of XRP cryptate could continue to pursue the company. At the same time, it rejected certain claims under California's securities laws, refused to recognize the personal liability of the CoO Ripple Brad Garlinghouse and the company's use of false information in the promotion of the cryptovalate. The plaintiffs are allowed to re-form them within 28 days.  The judge considered Ripple &apos; s arguments that the plaintiffs had applied to the court after the statute of limitations had expired to be justified. However, the opinion did not apply to possible violations under federal law, she explained.  ""Even though the defendants did accept various offers and sales in 2013 when they were dealing with the Northern California District Attorney's Office in May 2015, the activity at that time does not indicate the direction of XRP sales to the general public,"" Hamilton writes.  Former investors in the XRP with Ripple have been on trial for more than a year. According to the claimants, they sold unregistered securities. Ripple categorically denies his guilt and claims that the decision against her could completely destroy the third capitalization cryptate. Previously, several individual claims had been consolidated into one and referred to the Federal Court for further consideration."

3143290,"Yearn Finance representatives have for some time discussed the expansion of YFI as a way to encourage developers working on a decentralized finance platform (DeFi). The voting took place on Snapshot's web application (started on 28 January and ended on 2 February) Yearn Finance is a collectively developed robot-advisor for profit, which quickly became a portal to the DeFi sector. It is controlled by YFI, which is currently worth over $30,000.  According to the original concept of ""fair start"" of the project, there is a total of 30,000 YFIs. If the new currents were created right now and did not affect market capitalization, it would be expected that the value of YFI would fall to about $25,000 (i.e., the total cost of new currents would be $167 million), but the market response is difficult to predict.  The final result of the vote in favour of the increase was 1,670 YFI in favour and 331 YFI against. According to the documentation, the quorum for voting is 20 per cent in YFI glass. However, it has not yet been possible to determine how many YFI holders voted."

3143294,"A Nigerian fraudster embezzled $15.3 million and converted it into bitcoin. Apparently, these funds are non-refundable, writing a local edition of the Daily Post with reference to the FBI's statement.  Olalekan Jacob Ponle staged a large-scale phishing scheme and attacked two Chicago firms, getting them to hand over assets from their accounts. Staff thought they received letters from chief accountants when they were actually sent by a fraudster.  Ponle was arrested last week by the Dubai police, along with 11 associates, as a result of Operation Fox Hunt 2. It was estimated that he had suffered the damage of $44 million and that 1.9 million people might have been the victims. All detainees were extradited to the United States. They're charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.  According to the FBI, some of Ponle's funds were converted into bitcoin. They can be irretrievably lost. Although the FBI does not specify the reasons, this is probably due to the fact that the keys to the wallets were at Ponle's house and were not found.  "" A preliminary analysis of the blockage showed that Ponle received at least 1,494.7,150,6296 bitcoins, estimated at $6,599,499.98, "" states the publication. The losses of the victims of the scheme are measured by tens of millions of dollars. Ponle sent middlemen to the United States who opened accounts in the United States for the names of the victims' companies. The revenues of the scheme, ranging from several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars, were transferred by unsuspecting employees in an account opened by Ponle's intermediaries. He then gave them teams to convert the profits into bitcoins and send them to his wallet."""

3143297,"  The Emitant of the Tether Staplecoin announced this Thursday the launch of his new current, which will be provided with gold this time.  According to the company, Tether Gold ""gives possession of one triple ounce of pure material gold in a defined gold bar"". The new stylcoin has received the XAU\ ticker and will be released as a current on the Ethereum and TRON blocks.  ""Ther Gold is launched in response to the growing demand for digital assets that provide access to the world's most living asset and geopolitical need for an alternative financial system,"" reports Tether.  The gold used to provide the currents will be located in a Swiss vault, the name and location of which is not specified. Tether will not charge customers with a commission to store precious metal or have direct control over the storage facility.  ""Teter Gold provides a combination of tangible and digital asset benefits, removing gold storage costs in more traditional ways associated with high costs and access restrictions,"" said Technical Director Tether Paolo Ardoino.  According to Tether, XAU holders will be able to exchange their currents for gold after verification and with minimum transaction requirements. The minimum direct purchase amount for XAU is 50 units or 50 triple ounces of gold, which is approximately $75,000. The smaller units of XAU should be available for purchase at exchanges up to 0.00001 triple ounces.  The Golden Token will supplement the Tether family of assets tied to the United States dollar, the euro and the offshore renminbi."

3143299,"The Bitfinex Crime Exchange will interrupt the bidding this Tuesday, 11 February, for technical work.  According to Bitfinex in his blog, the measure is aimed at increasing the stability and scalability of the infrastructure of her parent company iFinex. Bitfinex used similar language during previous breaks due to planned technical works, usually without going into detail.  ""This is a key upgrade to the infrastructure for launching a new wave of scaling improvements on Bitfinex,"" writes the technical director of Paolo Ardoino's Twitter exchange. - Significant improvements in response time and API productivity are expected.  The work starts at 1 p.m. and lasts 4-7 hours. At this time, the infrastructure of all iFinex trade services will not be available, including Bitfnex bidding and purse transactions. It is worth noting that Bitfinex, unlike some other exchanges, usually falls within the stated time frame for the execution of the work.  Commenting on users &apos; comments on the lack of early notification of the forthcoming Bitfinex break, Ardoino reported that until the last moment, the exchange could not confirm the willingness of the various teams to arrive at its data centre due to weather conditions in Europe. ""We'll try to get the upgrade done as soon as possible, but we still have to be careful,"" he added.  Why does it matter? According to CoinGecko, Bitfinex is ranked third in a normalized tender volume in 24 hours among the most trusted platforms for kryptalite trading."

The story started that everyone in my office wanted it. Well, or almost everything, the sample and the analysis aren't good for me. I mean, I've been looking down on you, and I've been thinking, what's the 30s?  What, are you gonna stay home and get your shirts? But the fact remains that my colleagues and girlfriends called dyson the best gift ever. I've been using ashan and normal, dry and dry for a couple of years!   I've decided to test the hair dryer, again, for 30k... and I have some bad news for you... now, apart from the fen, I need a vacuum cleaner, a styler, and maybe even a hand dryer that you can see in the public bathrooms. I don't know why yet, but I do.  And for you, as detailed and honest as possible, because for many, it's worth a lot of money. First of all, it's PREMIAL. I thought it was a sin to buy, squeeze, and be upset, but no. Now it's our turn to dry the house. But no. I didn't think I was gonna say this about something, but if I let the analogy down, it's like starting to date Ryan Gling. I mean, the arm doesn't get tired in the process (with metaphors like this, I could be a sex blogger, but it didn't work) Third, it doesn't make a noise like we're gonna take off and sit in Tuganrog in a couple of hours.   Fourth, hair doesn't go bad 'cause there's no overheating. There's a feeling they're starting to look better, I don't know how true it is, but my tips are gone.   Fifthly, you can take it anywhere you want, because there's a whole fabric bag of magnets in it, and I'm usually gonna dry it out on the rides like this: out with a wet head, the breeze, and the god's gonna decide what the hair looks like today. Pushto carrying the technique with him -- the plan's not good -- it's gonna be hard and it's gonna break.  Fen's sneaky. You put it in your bag and you drive it safely. She weighs like a shirt.   Six, he's changing his temperature, four of them, I'm gonna dry on the coldest.   I really wanted to find the wrongs. There's one. He's a kid. But you know this minus without me. Other than that, the news is very bad, I fell in love with him.

3143307,"Alistair Miln reported on Wednesday that he woke up with ""bad news"", his wallet containing one bitcoin was hacked. That, however, was the purpose of Mild's event.  At the end of May, Miln announced that he would periodically post tips on Twitter that would help solve a 12-word seed-frase from his wallet. The entrepreneur provided options using over-the-counter techniques and promised to post three to four last words at a time. Still, he didn't have to do it. The Brutus Miln feared worked after the eighth word. It took the lucky man only 44 hours to find the right combination.  He explained that he intended to make the process more accessible to a wide range of users in order to reduce the chances of those with special skills to deal with such challenges. So he wanted to experiment with how quickly a potential intruder could crack a wallet with a certain amount of raw data.  Seed-frase contains 12 or 24 words and, if necessary, allows access to the cryptation wallet to be returned if the user does not have a private key for some reason. According to some estimates, breaking seed frazes from zero can last billions of years, Decrypt says. With every word published, the chances of burglars being successful have increased.  Miln praised the hacker for his tenacity. He also noted that he had paid a high commission in 0.01 BTC to get Bitcoin off his wallet, probably fearing competitors.  ""He must have rented some GPUs to do it so quickly! I knew that time wasn't on my side, but I thought most people would have four words to catch up with for a few weeks,"" Miln added."
3143308,"Tifon, a network of Croatian petrol stations, will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments for fuel and other products and services in partnership with Electrocoin.  Through a partnership with cryptocurrency payment platform PayCek from Electrocoin, 46 Tifon gas stations in Croatia will begin accepting BTC, ETH, XLM, XRP and EOS for goods and services.  According to Nikola Škorić, Electrocoin CEO, PayCek will convert cryptocurrencies to Croatia's national currency, the kunas, and then transfer them to Tifon.  Tifon said the new service could be popular with foreign and local tourists who visit Croatian cities and coastlines in summer. Tifon Chief Financial Officer Ana Lokas said:  ""Although cryptocurrency payments in Croatia are still in the early stages of expansion, with the introduction of this payment option at all Tifon stations, we expect further growth and development in this sector.""  Recall that in 2019, the Croatian Post announced a test launch of the service for exchanging cryptocurrencies for cash in the city of Zadar. The service was also provided in partnership with Electrocoin."
3143309,"By Bitcoin, the volume of short positions on the Bitfinex exchange grew by 50% + literally in a couple of hours. During the price increase, in the range 7250-7429 very large short positions with a total volume of over 11,000 BTC were opened. Such actions are typical for a large player. The crowd, as a rule, sells at the bottom and buys on tops. However, the volume of shorts again exceeded the long, and this, as we have already found out, is a rather strong bullish signal. After all, stop-loss shorts are fuel for growth"
3143310,"The Chicago Commodity Exchange (CME) group is starting bidding on the new Ethereum Futures market. ""Feuchers on the air: launch at 6:00 p.m. ET on Sunday (02:00 Moscow on Monday) to prepare for the first day of the bidding on Monday, February 8,"" wrote the exchange on Twitter.  The bid data show that the first block deal on the new instrument has already been concluded. It was worth 20 contracts, and the price of performance was $1650.  One contract in the futures of the CME corresponds to 50 ETH. So the volume of the transaction was 1,000 ETH or $1.65 million at the time of execution. Block transactions are individual futures transactions and other instruments that are carried out outside the CME application book.  CME announced the Ethereum futures in mid-December. They are calculated in traditional currency according to the reference rate CME CF Ether-Dollar. The minimum size of a block transaction is five contracts. In order to ensure liquidity in cryptonic futures markets, CME attracts many players, some of whom are active in the digital market, such as BlackFi, Galaxy, Genesis and NYDIG.  Although the launch of controlled futures appears to be an important step in the process of spreading the asset to large investors, 24 hours before the opening of the market on CME, the increase in the air rate has been replaced by a fall. From a peak of about $1,750, the price of cryptivates went down to zone $1,540. As one version, the decline is due to the expectations of traders that ETH will repeat the fate of the BTC, for which the launch of futures on CME in 2017 marked the start of the bear market. However, the low level of activity at the start, as it had been before, would help to dispel the speculative fears of market participants.  ""The fear of launching ETH futures at CME is ridiculous. It's not just that it comes from one single starting point. There are clear differences between the market conditions in December 2017 and now. Besides, I don't think that institutionalists are leaning towards short positions on ETH,"" writes an analyst, Messari Ryan Watkins."

3143313,"The largest BitMEX crypto-derivative exchange this morning drew the attention of its subscribers on Twitter to the fact that the descriptions of some of its trading mechanisms were copied without any changes by the Binance exchange.  “Congratulations on launching a futures test network, Binance. We are glad that you enjoyed reading our documentation no less than we should write it! ”Says BitMEX.  In particular, this concerns the descriptions of the auto-de-delivery option and the financing rate, which are 100 percent consistent.  CEO Binance Changpen Zhao commented on the situation: “Shame on us! I apologize. We missed this point in the DD process before the acquisition (we ourselves did not read the BitMEX documentation). We will correct ourselves as soon as possible. ”  As follows from the words of Zhao, BitMEX descriptions on Binance migrated along with the crypto-derivative platform JEX, the acquisition of which Binance announced last week. He also said that Binance has prepared its documentation for the futures exchange, the development of which it is engaged from scratch. Earlier, Binance opened a vote among its users for a platform that will subsequently become the official division of Binance under the Binance Futures brand.  Some of the participants in the discussion, meanwhile, note that BitMEX, while developing its platform, could also be inspired by the ideas of third-party companies. In particular, we are talking about the tools of the OKCoin exchange, which were created by her at the time when Zhao worked as its technical director until the founding of Binance."

The regulator promises ""to take monitoring measures, including interrogations and checks, and to prohibit the activities of entities falling into his field of vision-related to virtual currencies in order to timely eliminate the corresponding risks.""  The bank notes that cryptocurrency speculation is growing amid the advancement of blockchain technology, and urges investors not to confuse these two concepts.  “There are many risks in the field of financing through the issuance of digital currencies and their exchange, including the risks of false assets, the risks of a business collapse, the risks of investment speculation and so on. Investors should pay close attention to preventing such risks and beware of fraud, ”the publication said.  According to the Shanghai branch, people involved in securing the turnover of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other virtual currencies, as well as participating in related activities, violate a number of provisions of the law, including unlawful fundraising, issuing unregistered securities, organizing fraudulent schemes and financial pyramids, which ultimately seriously harm the economic well-being of the country.  This week, Shanghai authorities, including a Central Bank unit, conducted an audit aimed at identifying cases of illegal trade in cryptocurrencies and the distribution of tokens issued through the infrastructure of foreign platforms.  In addition, today the Shenzhen administration announced its own investigation, during which it managed to detect 39 illegal platforms for exchanging digital currencies."
3143318,"A senior researcher at nChain, Craig Wright, who has earned the ill fame of a man trying to convince the public that he was hiding under the pseudonym of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, responded to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the USA (CFTC) about the cryptocurrency Ethereum.  “My name is Dr. Craig Wright. Under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, I completed a project that I started in 1997, ”he writes.  Wright claims that colossal amounts of false information and misunderstanding accompany Bitcoin and “all the derivative systems on the blockchain (including Ethereum),” and this is what forced him to start more active public activities.  “The system I created was partially intended to eradicate fraud as much as possible with technology. The blockchain's little insight has led to the spread of false information and the revival of old fraudulent schemes, ”writes Wright, noting that many of these schemes have taken the form of ICO.  He also describes the transformations that Bitcoin and blockchain technology as a whole made to the trading process, ensuring compliance with the terms of the agreements when transferring rights to financial instruments between traders.  “Ethereum is a poorly crafted copy of Bitcoin, aimed at fulfilling promises in smart contracts that were represented in Bitcoin itself, but were locked by its developers. The Ethereum network has already reached its limit and, in fact, is used only by unscrupulous offices, which are organized in such a way as to mislead those who do not have sufficient technical knowledge of market participants. Ethereum did not provide any technology for computing, and the ICO did not create anything that would not exist before them, ”Wright added.  This week, Wright also commented on the news about the launch of the cryptocurrency of JPMorgan bank, stating that he ""has patents on what they are going to do,"" for which he was nicknamed the ""patent troll."""

3143331,"They say wolves aren't tigers, they don't perform in the circus, but how do you explain the fact that I've been doing tricks here for the second day in a row? Actually, there's an explanation, and it's a lot more prosaic than kids' quotes. After almost a year of quarantine, I went back on a permanent basis to the office, which means you can basically paint your face so you don't scare people in the elevator at the business center.   Today in the arena, the mascara is coloured. Cheap. Beautiful. The color mascara for me is very much about the baby senses: Avon's catalog, the Glucose section for teenagers (there was definitely purple powder from the plums, and how much I loved it!), a school where you bragging to your girlfriend that you came with blue eyelashes, and you were washed by the housekeeper at the entrance. These are the eyelashes of spider's legs, carefully taken out under the psych ward before the bath. Anyway, it's a high.   I recently found purple carcasses in the mass market (before that I had ysl, it was beautiful in everything except the price and what ended), and what do you think? A friend found vivien sabo cabaret premiere in the most appropriate shade — beautiful, bright purple, which is really visible in eyelashes, not dark-syrenium, which is a comfort to you, namely, FYOLET, like a grape blazer.   The second fit of hysteria is the turquoise art screeching. I used to throw it in the basket at the Internet store, but I think there's definitely one in the apple. Of course, she bought a color — full-blown, gum, and cocktail at the club in 2010 with local DJ music.   If purple makes sense, and in principle the world should put a monument to the man who invented the cabaret mascara, then I was green; on the first day, it seemed pretty hard to lay down, but then I remembered that I carried about four layers of greener. And yes, it's an easy minus -- I like it brightly, like in the zero clips, so that it shines and burns. But with two or three layers, that's how it works. It's literally like a tree for a car with the smell of menthol.   Both of them are doing great all day long, Vivien survived this weekend in Moscow (when we all became Norilsk residents) and didn't get printed in the upper century, even though for justice, my eyelashes are short as a rabbit.  They're sneaking around, I'm just taking out a water wash, no stains, no divorces, and that's all.

Kmk, the product brief isn't very fair to such a good brand, so I'm gonna roll you a little bit. Today's theme is troublesome skin. Pimples, we're picking you!   My contact with Lush started five years ago with the Megamat mask, the giant pelvis with which was standing in the bathroom of a former boyfriend. If I've taken anything normal out of this relationship, it's a Megamate mask. The baby treats, drys, straightens up. Be careful, though, if the achilles heel is sensitive, the mask is nuclear, the face is drawn to God. Think, before you put it on your face every day, without skin, you won't get married.   A fresh Amazon mask. Called to fight pimples and other causes of failure in your personal life. It takes a long time to get used to her clay garlic smell and pieces of garlic inside. But you're used to your boyfriend. When used regularly (each day), the skin does become smoother and smoother.   Fresh mint chocolate mask for teenage skin from fat glitter and pimples. There's no need for words, a cheap and silent recommendation. If you're an 8th grader like me, Vadick, you're a awful loser. You can use it every day, like a face after a spa. (I wasn't there, but I think it feels the same.)  Tea tree face tonic. It calms and purifies. Too bad it's just the skin, not the nervous system. It's a good thing with an earthen smell, and I'm doing it after I wash, and I believe in a miracle.   Coal black soap. I don't want to write anything, I didn't get in at all, even though I tried it repeatedly. It's gonna be rough, and then the skin's fat and red.   Oatmeal soap. Norm, but it's not gonna happen. It's soft, it's not dry.   That's what I use all the time. The cleaning line of the brand is much wider and asks itself to try. I love lush, alibiderci!"

3143350,"“Coinbase Wallet already supports Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and more than 100,000 ERC20 tokens and collection items from the ERC721 standard based on Ethereum. Our goal when working with Coinbase Wallet is to create the world's leading crypto-wallet, the storage of assets in which is carried out by users, ”the company wrote.  Coinbase Wallet supports both SegWit addresses and old format addresses. In addition, users can switch to the Bitcoin test network in advanced settings.  In today's announcement, Coinbase also confirmed that it continues to work on the integration of Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin ""and other popular cryptocurrencies.""  Earlier, some community members noted that Coinbase representatives deliberately avoid mentioning Bitcoin in their public statements, and even assumed that the exchange is building its policy in such a way as to shake the status of the first cryptocurrency."
3143351,"  Last week's Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have had a ""drama effect"" on both forks, increasing the risk of attacks by 51%, are considered by Arcane Research analysts. The share of the heshrate BCH and BSV in the combined SHA-256 algorithm has more than halved.  The Bitcoin Cash share fell from 3.4% to 1.5%, Bitcoin SV by exactly 50%, and Bitcoin SV by 2.4% to 1.2%.  This increases the risk of an attack by 51%, as shown by the abnormal behaviour of the unit production rate, noted in Arcane Research.  After the chalwing, the new BCH unit appeared, on average, 19.5 minutes later than the 10 specified by the algorithm. The rate of generation of blocks has reached the planned rate after 144 blocks, which is due to the complexity of the adjustment mechanism. However, the volatility of the indicator remains much higher than before the Halwing.  The most frequently generated is 2-3 blocks per hour, and approximately every 7 hours there is an acceleration, sometimes reaching 30 blocks per hour. According to the experts, as a result of the fall of the hashrate, the major engineers gained more control over the network and were able to play with the complexity control algorithm. As a result, they thus ""press"" as many blocks as possible per unit of energy consumption, reducing the cost of producing coins.  Against the backdrop of the drop in the hashrate of the forks, market participants noted the release of their operators into the bitcoin network, which grew by about 15 EH/s after the BCH and BSVs. According to analysts, however, migrants could not make a significant contribution to this, with 3 EH/s being lost from fork networks.  Accordingly, the experts concluded that a possible re-entry of the engineers after the Bitcoin chalwing in May would have no impact on the network of the first cryptoval.  Bitcoin may be a problem with reducing the rate of generation of blocks, as the Halvings of Forks have shown. In doing so, their rate became relatively fast, as it is adjusted through 144 blocks. The BTC has this every two weeks or 2016 blocks, noted in Arcane Research.  Previously, the problem had been brought to the attention of researchers from Coin Metrics.  Experts &apos; views on the possible impact of the upcoming reduction of the Bitcoin Award on the price of bitcoin, other side events and expectations, read in ForkLog magazine:  "

Coinbase, bitFlyer EU, Bitstamp, and Gemini are some of the most expensive spot exchanges for retail traders, although Gemini offers the lowest commissions to large traders.  Binance used to be one of the least expensive crypto exchanges, but now it offers fairly high commissions to large traders.

The XRB digital asset will soon become compatible with data storage devices once the development team releases the update.  Given the unique features of NANO's work, which is that each user has his own blackchin, the data can be stored not only on small devices.  Thus, universal blocks will help maintain the XRB balance by reducing the history of unnecessary data. This would make it easier to add currents to wallets like Trezor, or Nano.  While XRB digital assets are fairly new, security and storage remain a challenge, especially after the theft of the BitGrail."

Now Xyushi has an important phase in her life — she gave up her hateful work before the New Year to dedicate herself to a favorite cause — Ksyusha has been renting a small workshop in a pit for months, doing a little repairs there, and creating small and lovely household welfare items for pets. First she went there on her weekend, and now she's ready to devote all her time.  I know how hard it has been for her to make this decision: the material side of life is important when you're an adult and you're not born in a wealthy family, she drinks, cuts, skins and dyes, collects all the details with her own hands. I know things don't work out the first time, that something breaks down, that something's being cut off crooked, that's some unexpected moments, something else. But I also know how much support is important in this world.  Xyusha has put out the first items for sale today — small bowls for feed and water. They're at different levels to keep the food crumbs out of the water, and it's been clean and fresh longer.  Anything Ksyusha does is very hearty. For example, her second pet interior object is a bedclothes that is attached to the battery because Xyusha has a sphinx that is constantly freezing.

3143378,"BitPay crypto-payment service CEO Stephen Pier is confident that to a large extent the current value of Bitcoin is based on speculation, and only a small part of it is based on practical value. With the help of his company Pier intends to change the situation.  “A very large component of the price, of course, is associated with speculation. Investors are speculating on the future application and distribution of Bitcoin. A small component of the price is its real practical significance. BitPay focuses on this issue - using the platform and providing products that our customers find valuable, ”he said in a conversation with CNBC.  According to Pier, in addition to Bitcoin-ETF, there are several ways to raise the price of cryptocurrency to the levels of the end of 2017. He expects that the current annual transaction volume of BitPay to $ 1 billion in several years will grow to $ 10 billion, and over time - to $ 100 billion when cryptocurrency will be supported by a wide range of retailers and payment applications. According to Pier, this dynamic will be the key to restoring the Bitcoin price.  He also assumes that the blockchain's capabilities will go far beyond the limits of the cryptocurrency space when the technology will begin to be widely used to form databases. According to his estimates, after 3-5 years, customers will be able to go to a restaurant or shop, reasonably expecting that they will support payments on the blockchain.  “We believe that the majority of digital assets will be issued on the blockchain, like most payments made with it. This vision is not limited to bitcoin or tokens that exist today. The blockchain will be issued dollars and euros. Therefore, speaking of payments on the blockchain, we are not talking only about bitcoin payments. We are talking about all types of digital assets that can be used to make payments, ”he concluded."

And above all: if they are stolen or lost from you: how can you prove that they are actually your items?  If you are like the S4FE Token Team a few years ago, you will be amazed that there is not really a good solution for these simple problems. At least so far.  Thousands of other people also recognized this problem in 2018 when S4FE experienced a huge hype and appeared on magazines like Forbes and was pushed on Instagram by famous personalities like Floyd Mayweather after he participated in the # s4fe challenge. Since the successful private sale with accredited investors in the same year and the subsequent token launch in 2019, S4FE has researched and worked intensively on a solution, and is now almost two years later with a fully functional product about to launch.  S4FE works like this: They have designed a very, very small physical chip that manufacturers can easily implant directly into their products (such as handbags, shoes, but also watches and cameras).

Now you can register as the owner of this product, report it as stolen and lost, safely resell and auction it to someone else, etc. All this data is stored securely and encrypted in the blockchain.  As you can imagine, the development of all the technology behind it took a lot of work - but S4FE is now about to start with a product that works ex-actly as described and will be launched in the coming weeks.

Another good example is the exemplary lucky women at the stoves who taste salad.  Here we go. Why is this happening?

The more people don't use their BTC frequently, the inelastic the supply becomes, the higher the price, the higher the utility of BTC as a SoV.  For ETH (also ATOM, DOT, TON, SOL, NEAR), the value is formed by calculations and gas burning.

3143434,"  The Blockchain Association has submitted a new memorandum in support of Telegram, stating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contradicts its own claims.  It will be recalled that at the end of March, the court temporarily blocked the release and distribution of Gram currents. When Telegram's lawyers asked the court to clarify whether the ban on currents applied only to American investors, SEC opposed the request, calling it a ""hidden move"" to review the court's decision. The Court upheld the Commission and explained that the prohibition applied to all natural and legal persons in any country.  However, in the view of the Blackchain Association, SEC abandons its own provisions on the allocation of digital assets, thereby forcing issuers to act in the face of legal inconsistencies and uncertainties. As the Association pointed out in the memorandum, ""there is no precedent or set of rules at this time that would make it clear in which cases digital assets may be recognized as securities"".  Blockchain Association is convinced that the position of the court and SEC is contrary to previous statements of the Commission. Telegram has made every effort to meet the requirements of SEC, in particular regulation ""D"", which allows firms to sell assets to investors suitable for certain criteria, without the need to provide the detailed report required of public equity companies. Telegram used the ""Simple Agreement for Future Currents"" (SAFT) method, in which the currents were sold through investment contracts with the reservation that these currents may not necessarily be securities.  According to the Blackchain Association, SEC encouraged the use of the SAFT model and its consistency with ""D"" regulation, so Telegram developers were surprised that they had been prosecuted for complying with these requirements.

3143435,"Iran is likely to seek to ensure that existing capital does not leave the country affected by the sanctions.  According to the decrypt with reference to the local edition, the country's Central Bank (CBI) prohibits trade in both the oldest cryptated and other digital assets that have been produced outside Iran.  This innovation seems to be a formality, since Iran has already, in effect, banned open crypto-trade. However, experts believe that clarification may indicate a desire on the part of local regulators to resist the withdrawal of existing capital inflows outside the region.  Mining crypts in the country are quite profitable and cost-effective, thanks to oil and natural gas deposits. Since the beginning of the legalization of kryptomining (non-trade), Iran has been seeking to regulate the industry for its own benefit since the beginning of the past year.  For example, in the autumn of 2020, in the hope of preventing American sanctions, CBI imposed an obligation on the country &apos; s registered BTC engineers to market their acquired assets to the central bank. This decision provided another option for the country to pay for imports, subject to currency restrictions.  The new ban still has some logistical obstacles, because it is not clear how the scheme itself can guarantee that the Bitcoins will not enter the region.  However, attorney Fatema Fannisade, on Twitter, observed that she did not believe that the decision would be circulated at the individual level.  It believed that since stock exchange platforms could not function in principle, the innovation, instead of a total ban, made it possible for banks as well as fortex-officers to use Iranian crypto-assets in international transfers.  Iran, like Cuba, Syria, the Sudan and a number of other regions, does not have access to the SWIFT network. Thus, according to Fannisade, the country's leaders plan to be aggressive in exporting Iranian coins, encouraging mining, and countering capital flight in the face of depreciating rials."

I'm waiting for people in this 1% to run their products, and I can talk to their clients,"" Kalakanis wrote on Twitter.  In the middle of last year, Kalakanis expressed the view that Bitcoin was out of date and would be replaced by a new cryptoval project, and its course would fall to zero.

According to the service, the vast majority of investors had not sold their assets for a long time. In particular, 77.7 per cent of coins were not moved for six months, 57.6 per cent remained intact for an entire year, and 31.6 per cent were held for two years.  An impressive amount of fixed funds indicates that most investors have long-term plans for the second largest capitalization crypthalate. In the last six months, the price of ETH has risen by almost $100, but this has not led to massive sales to capture profits.  Bitcoin's keepers have similar tactics. According to Glassnode, 42.8% of all BTCs did not move for two years. This represents an increase of 10.4 per cent over the previous year.

Director General Uphold J. P. Thierio (J. P. Thieriot) reported that the platform had expanded the list of supported stylcoins to meet the growing demand for stable crypts, especially the US dollar-backed ones. He said that the stylcoins attached to the violet currencies in the ratio of 1 to 1 were much less volatile than conventional crypthalates and would be used faster by central banks from different countries. Stablecoin Center is designed to enable people to operate with stable currents, not only in the cryptoval market, but also in traditional banking networks.  ""Stylcoins can fill the gaps and gaps in an outdated financial system. Fiat currencies will remain units of account. Moving from a bank to a digital dollar would increase the speed of operations, provide more options and possibly a higher interest rate,"" J. P. Thierio.  The head of Uphold added that, with Stablecoin Center, users would be able to compare stylcoins in terms of transparency, auditing, liquidity and available interest rates. According to Thierio, stable cryptivates have gone a long way, and the new stylcoins can outnumber older versions of currents in many ways. Therefore, when selecting supported stepplecoin, Uphold adhered to the principles of accessibility, financial stability and interaction.  The new service will provide Uphold users with access to crypto-assets through debit and credit cards, as well as bank accounts in more than 40 countries. Supported stylcoins can generate 10 per cent of income through a external credit application Credit Earn. Director-General Cred Earn Dan Shuttt (Dan Schatt) said that this interaction was evidence of the ""growing up"" of the cryptoval market. In the future, Uphold plans to add new stylcoins that will meet the requirements and demand among traders.  Last year, Uphold was going to introduce the Ledger Vault Castodial solution to improve safety and security against forced entry."

In response to a question about the National Defence Act, the amendments of which provide for tests of the use of new financial technologies in the financing of terrorism, Yellen stated: ""We need to make sure that our methods of dealing with these issues change with the financing of terrorism along with changes in technology. The crypthaluts are of particular concern.""  According to Yellen, ""many crypthalates are used, at least in the context of transactions, mainly for illegal financing"".  ""I think we really need to explore ways in which we can reduce their use and make sure that money laundering is not bypassed through these channels,"" she added.  On November 30, 2020, Joe Biden nominated Yellen as Minister of Finance in his future administration.

3143490,"The card will be issued as part of the Visa Fast Track project.  Payment company Visa has partnered with startup Circle Internet Financial, the developer of the popular Ethereum-based stablecoin - U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC). Forbes writes about it.  Visa will help Circle negotiate with card issuers who can integrate the startup's software into their platforms. This gives them the opportunity to include USDC in the list of available financial instruments. So the project team will be able to expand the scope of stablecoin application.  The partnership with the payment system will open up the possibility for USDC users to pay with digital assets at all Visa card acceptance points. The process involves the instant conversion of stablecoin to fiat currency. For this, the payment company, among other things, plans to issue a business card.      “It will be the first corporate bank card that will allow businesses to spend their USDC,” said Visa's head of cryptocurrency, Cuy Sheffield, adding that the change could make the stablecoin more efficient.  Circle was selected by the payment system as part of the Visa Fast Track program, which aims to help fintech startups scale their business.  The event was commented on by billionaire head of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz. He believes that Visa's partnership with Circle indicates the approach of the ""era of cryptocurrencies."""

Once upon a time, instagram spaciously, I stumbled upon divine pink beards with a yearzilla. As the owner of all the fucking things in the universe, I've already dialed a card number to transfer the money. Then there was this white beard, because the sale, and I'm rich and stupid. All of these miracle beans belonged to a brand of bilingua.ladys from a cold, dark peter and were made with the tender hands of Inga's most beautiful flower.  I'd be okay, but that goat started making underwear. The whites are amazing, tricuting, boneless, and high waist. If anyone still thinks the high thalium in their underwear isn't sexy, just try spending the day with that beautiful witch. You feel like Claudia Schiffer at least in her best years and the flourishing of hippie culture. The most important thing is that nothing hits, pressures, feels on the body in principle, and comes out in white, black, nudity and olive.  And again, it would be okay, but she made a line with a napkin. I think I can just put Inge's money into a bill every month in exchange for my underwear so I don't have to worry about my choice.  I'm sharing my heart, really. I hope she falls asleep with a wave of orders, 'cause the price is funny, honest word: classic 900 rubles, hot 1500.  "

Well, I'm a weak-willed lady, I'm told I'm doing.  I tried a bronzer and a pink lipstick in a steak this morning, declared to be very sturdy. So far, okay. The bronzer is well under the cheekbones and on the lower chin line. Dry as powder and my skin around my eyes at the end of the week. It's a good stew.  Pink lipstick isn't much of mine, because it's associated with a high school math teacher, and I didn't like math very much, but I liked smoking with boys behind garages, which often overlapped with math. You know what choice was made and who came in. So the pink shade of lipstick and blue shadows for me are still synonymous with negative and 3 at the end of the quarter.  But in everything but the shade, lipstick like okay: it's good, it's not dry, it's been through coffee and the morning saddles.  The main plus stamp is definitely its price. The lipstick costs 186 rubles, 200-to-something bronzer. I went through the site and realized that there was a danger. I want everything. White lipstick, black lip gloss, and multifunctional shiny gels are especially dangerous!!! The shades are what I'd like to live: beyonce, disco, Vegas, Paris, sensation. Well, you know, put it on and lie down.  The price of this thing is 220 rubles, so the budget won't get too bad.   Also today, the Bible promises a flood in Moscow.

3143497,"Since most of the Nigerian kryptorina is clandestine or monorangian because of government restrictions, the country's securities regulator is looking for ways to make investment safer.  In 2021, financial institutions operating in Nigeria became the leverage of government repression, starting with the notorious central bank ban in February on creditors providing services to crypto-exchange exchanges in the country. Since most of Nigeria's kryptorina is a single-rangian woman, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now seeking to introduce rules that could streamline the industry and offer investors better protection.  According to a September 2 report, SEC has established a special financial technology unit charged with researching investments and products in cryptation and blocking, knowledge that can then be used in the future regulatory framework of cryptography. Director General Lamido Southuda told Reuters this week that the agency was ""attentively studying this market to see how we can develop rules that will help investors protect their investment in the blockade"".  The SEC of Nigeria, which believes that all crypto-assets ""are securities unless proven otherwise"", will be able to create a regulatory framework only if the cryptation is re-integrated into the country's banking system. It is reported that the Agency is also seeking to work with Fintech companies to strengthen the domestic securities market in order to prevent capital flight, which continues to be present in many sectors.  The exclusion of cryptivates from banking channels has not weakened the enthusiasm for this class of assets. On the contrary, during the year, with the potential for political and economic crises, including social and economic repression and unbridled inflation, the introduction of cryptivism continued to grow."

3143500,"The market's development continues to be directed upward, even after a rapid reversal of historical maximums, Bloomberg states in the new report.  Analysts say that Bitcoin is more likely to resume its upward trajectory to $100,000 than it will be below $20,000. This, they say, will be facilitated by freeing the market from a surplus of speculative positions, while all the fundamental prerequisites previously in place remain valid. The current situation is described as a ""bold kryptonian"" with a discount.  At the same time, they argue that if the trend continues, Ethereum may compete directly with Bitcoin for the place of the first cryptivate. They call attention to ETH as part of portfolio diversification.  ""Both have bull's premises, but the foundations and areas of application of the second issue are an important addition to the characteristics of the global stocking tool number one,"" Bloomberg writes. – Ethereum faces competition with other cryptos and smart-contract platforms, but number two won the distribution race and takes the lead platform for digitalizing money and finance.  They also believe that the growing capitalization of the Tether Staple is evidence of the demand for digital assets. ""Despite the ongoing debate and harassment of regulators, the growing market capitalization of the world's largest dollar-based current is a sustainable indicator of the expansion of the digital asset ecosystem. Stable Tether indicators deserve respect,"" Bloomberg adds.  In doing so, they refer to the $100,000 mark as the next target for bitcoin as consistent with the behavior of the crypts after the calvings. Aether, they expect, at least until the end of October, will remain within the range of $2,000 to $4,000.  ""If Bitcoin catches up to Ethereum's performance in 2021, the first crypt would go to $100,000. Add to this last year's decline in emissions, the migration of institutional portfolios, the futures to Etherum and the launch of ETF in Canada and Europe, and you will see that Bitcoin has much greater potential to go to $100,000 than to stay below $20,000,"" the report says."

Nyx doesn't have eyebrow pencils, but two chairs: one eyebrow is black, the other is fine.  A pencil that looks more like a self-defense knife if you live in Bootovo and you like to go out and come home later is divided into two parts: a brush to comb your eyebrows. It's not a big deal, it's a toothbrush and it's a toothbrush.  In fact, a pencil made in the best traditions of a pencil crawling out of a transition that's just trying to figure out what's going on and what's going on with your bed/pajama/old long shorts where you walk at home. (This is my case, added to every fireman, so you don't discriminate against yourself.)  As much as the pencil is crippled, it's awful hilarious. Seriously. It's so soft and natural to paint its eyebrows, it's getting a little scary. Sticks to the end of the day, doesn't drown, doesn't ask for too much attention. An awful soft texture that makes even the gentlest touch (as in the bleach ad or underwear air conditioner) provide a dense dark cover.  I often watch an instagram with a friend who's kind of like a guru eyebrow, so she's in there a lot of time in the statris making eyebrow karaoke, picking out the best pictures of the best living on her face.  In fact, I'm always afraid to open her storis and see my photos of her from 2007))000 With this pencil, there's a possibility that you won't get into karaoke, because it doesn't give clear lines, it doesn't give a smooth outline.

It will be recalled that, the other day, 3,200 ETHs were transferred from the co-founder Etherium Vitaly Bouterin's wallet to Etherum 2.0's deposit contract address.  At current rates, the total value of ETH steaking blocked exceeds $20 million. As Buterin explained in a blog article, steaking at Etherium 2.0 will yield about 15% of the income to the valifiers. Since valdiators cannot move or spend their ETH while they are blocked, an incentive system has been introduced.  Previously, Etherium 2.0 developers published on GitHub a tool to generate the keys needed to deposit a steaking deposit. The developer, Danny Ryan, said that 16,384 deposits at 32 ETH were to be deposited before 1 December to begin deployment of the main network of Etherium 2.0.

Anyway, I can't say anything about the smell, 'cause it's divine, it's doing a great job, it's holding on to something that even gets annoying because it's always eating.

Surprisingly, it doesn't absorb quickly, so you can walk half the day with sexy pussy from 2005.

Together with this, she raised $28 million in the B series investment round. Last September, the company attracted $23 million.  Now, Elliptic plans to expand in Asia and attract new labour to sell its latest Discovery product, which helps banks decide which exchanges they want to work with. The product includes more than 200 exchanges worldwide and covers such aspects of its activities as customer identification and local regulatory control.  Banks often avoid working with exchanges, despite the potential return on such relationships. As a result, crypto companies are forced to cooperate with a limited number of tolerant financial institutions, including the US banks Silvergate and Signature.  ""At present, most banks are unable to identify legal exchanges. This creates risks of money-laundering and sanctions. Discovery will allow them to adopt a risk-based approach and use our observations and data to determine the exchanges with which they can operate safely,"" announced to companies.  Wells Fargo became the first U.S. bank to support Elliptic. The Japanese banking group SBI Holdings and the Spanish bank Santander had previously invested in the company.

In fact, if in 2010 you were already at the +-conscious age, you remember well all these peaks in the form of requests for ""white"" lips, and you probably bought the brightest shade of tonalist to recreate all this beauty. Remember how everyone wore a pixy haircut during hipsters (I too) and how the guys got the andercat (beautiful right after the hairdresser, then the gulka on their head). The most interesting thing to see is that the lip and eyebrow category is growing, smashing the eyes out of the top.

3143551,"I often get comments for some media (although who needs them is a question. My comments, of course, not the media.  And there's always the same question: how do you feel about makeup? Are you wearing makeup for yourself or for the community?  I guess I'd like to say once and for all that I'd like to lie on the couch with crumbs of chips and do one big thing.  If you want to know a little bit more about the cosmetics industry, how women were forced to feel ""beauty,"" why it happened, how it evolved, where it came from, ""it's me for you,"" then read Naomi Wolf and her Myth of Beauty.   I don't take makeup for anything. I mean, it's great when I have the time, the energy, and the desire for all the manipulation, but if not, it's not scary.  It's weird for me to see some popular bloggers raise a question for yourself, either you wear makeup for your favorite or whatever makeup you like. I honestly don't give a shit who likes makeup.   Makeup is not a panacea, not a ritual binding on everyone, not a means to hide something, to cover it, to hide it, to adjust what most sales are built on (you must always be better than you are!!!!!), makeup is first and foremost one big fan that you may not need at all. I will never understand girls who, even in extreme living conditions (travel to work by 9, for example), will get up an hour earlier, feeling uncomfortable to get back.  From the moment you start to realize that there's no single recipe for ""this is here, this is here"", makeup becomes just a tool and an additional tool for expression, there's a mood today, tomorrow, no.   You're sitting there thinking, ""I get it, why does she even write it?"" The thing is, you and I are sitting here in a very comfortable environment, like we're wearing soft pillows at a pajama party, we all know, we all know, and I saw last night in Instagram watching an influenner with a million-dollar, almost-pretty-painting audience find out."

Statistics show that in more than two weeks Ethereum burned 73,784 ethers worth more than $230 million at today's exchange rate.  Data from Dune Analytics show that since the update. On 5 August, 73,784 ETH was burned. The Hard Fork went well, and after it was introduced, Vitalik Buterin said he was sure of the project. Buterin also reported that, in his view, EIP-1550 was a very important part of the network modernization.  Long before the update, the ETH community was ready for the long-awaited EIP-1559 upgrade. After the changes, more than two weeks have passed and people are watching how much ester burns every day.  To date, 73,784 ETH has been burned, which is about US$ 230,611,450 at today's exchange rate. Each ETH participant is involved in the combustion process, and there are many Ethereum-based protocols that burn ETH simply by working.  Dune Analytics statistics show that the market for non-mutual currents (NFT) Opensea is the largest combustioner today (9,121 ethers). Further projects include Uniswap V2 (5,365 Axie Infinity (4,024 Esters), Tether (3,733 Esters) and Uniswap V3 (2236 Esters). Other projects and applications, such as Metamask (1405 ethers), USDC (1,258 ethers) and 1inch V3 (991 ethers), also burn many ETHs.  At present, more than 12,000 dollars are burned in the Ethereum chain every minute."

3143579,"The well-known analyst Tom Lee claims that the arguments of skeptics waiting to lower the cost of the lead cryptically fail. Several significant factors are not taken into account by the supporters of the Bear Forecasts.  Many financiers are associated with a decline in Bitcoin search requests and a decline in its value. Indeed, since the beginning of 2018, the total number of Internet queries has declined by almost 75 per cent. In Tom Lee's view, this indicator is more likely to coincide than to determine the future behaviour of the market. Many large financial institutions are now showing interest in cryptivate. Lee assures us that the market is experiencing a short-term recession, which is accompanied by a decline in demand.  More than that, many analysts point to a decline in the volume of bidding. Similarly, they fell by 75 per cent relative to the level of December. ""A comparison of market activity at the beginning of the year with last year's performance increased by 900 per cent"", Tom noted.  At last, many share the view that Bitcoin will not be able to overcome an important psychological barrier of $10,000. "" Bitcoin is gaining all the power in 10 days. I do not think that his current situation at current levels will in any way prevent him from rising above by the end of the year.""  Together with the analyst, considering the possibility of falling the price, he thinks the course will be around $6,000. This is due to the current average cost of Bitcoin production."

The company &apos; s decision was to protect new users who were confused when trying to buy bitcoin on the platform. Another factor has been the threats of legal persecution posed by Bitcoin SV Craig Wright to members of the cryptoval community.  ""It's a tough decision. We had a choice, and there was unintended damage, but we had to stick to a larger principle that we believed in,"" said CEO OkCoin Hun Fang, adding that they had tried not to rely on their own opinions on the matter. However, because of Wright's latest series of threats, it has become a matter of principle for OKCoin to sue portals that make White Paper Bitcoin publicly available.  ""On the one hand, we fully support the morale of the open-source community. On the other hand, if we're doing something in this direction, it's contrary to our principles as a neutral platform. We wouldn't have made those changes if Craig Wright hadn't begun to threaten the developers. We consider these threats to be very destructive for bitcoin as a whole, "" reported Fan. - Besides, when all three of these coins are on our platform and new customers come to it, most people want to buy bitcoin as a savings tool. But when they see BSV and BCH, it confuses them.  As early as 2019, a number of exchanges, including Kraken, Binance and ShapeShift, conducted the Bitcoin SV tortization after the Wright incident. Many of them, however, still support the Bitcoin Cash. Fan hopes the rest of the trading platforms will follow the example of OKCoin. ""We call on other members of the community to defend the spirit of free development and decentralization,"" she said."

The names of more than 100 of them are associated with the Libra cryptocurrency, a few dozen with the Calibra digital wallet. Some are already used to display malicious content.  “Instead of using the hype in the media and the rush around the brand, such fraudulent schemes are often disguised as an official website and thus may cause more user confidence, who will be more inclined to give them financial and personal data,” said a company representative.  Presumably, fraudsters use characters from different alphabets to replace individual elements of the original names. At least six domain names were found mentioning Libra and Calibra, where this method was used.  Earlier, one web site from this category was seen on the network, whose visitors were offered to take part in the Libra presale and purchase a cryptocurrency with a discount."

3143598,"  Unprecedented in recent history, a 50 per cent batcoin collapse in one day led some market participants to reflect on the establishment of a mechanism that would help prevent such situations from occurring in the future.  The US stock market, for example, uses a specialized system to stop bidding if the decline exceeds 7 per cent, 13 per cent and 20 per cent. When the first threshold is reached, the bidding stops for 15 minutes, allowing the price to stabilize. On March 12, S&P 500 dropped by 7.02% to 2,549.05 points, resulting in a stoppage on the New York Stock Exchange.  The managing partner, Multilateral Capital Tushar Jane, believes that the crypto market also needs such a system. ""The market is being cryptized today at the structural level. Leading stock exchanges must come together to prevent this situation from happening again,"" he writes.  Jane also notes that the entire decentralized finance ecosystem (DeFi) has ""nearly died"" and several of its major players have failed. Many DeFi platforms use Etherum as collateral. In order to avoid liquidations against the background of the collapse of the cryptivate, their users had to urgently contribute additional assets, but they could not always do so because of the congestion of the network.  ""If we have to accept that a crypt could fall 60%+ in a day, it would significantly limit the practical value of technology,"" Jane added.  The idea of a partner, Multilateral Capital, however, did not receive visible support in the community. ""This is what the supporters wanted: a decentralized free market that no one controls, driven by demand and supply. Nothing can be done without violating the key principles of the blockade. People must accept this as the norm,"" said one commentator."

In September, Microsoft added $175 million to the funds already invested, bringing the total to $425 million. Thus Microsoft became the first public company to acquire a large volume of bitcoins to hold them as a reserve asset.  In its press release, Coinbase quotes the CEO MicroStrategy of Michael Sailor, who stated that investment in Bitcoin was part of his company's ""new asset strategy"". The strategy aims to maximize long-term returns for shareholders through cryptatization as a means of accumulation with higher growth potential than in the storage of a violet currency.  Coinbase describes three reasons why Microsoft chose to use its service to buy bitcoin: a smart application system, trade algorithms, and additional services. The exchange was involved in several pre-transaction calls, in one of which it was asked to perform a ""test operation"". This made it possible to determine the optimal rate of purchase in order to reduce the impact of market fluctuations, after which Microsoft approved a ""large investment"".  ""Our system takes one large bid and divides it into many small parts, which are conducted through different trading platforms. The team reached the average performance price, which was lower than the price at the start of the purchase,"" says Coinbase."

3143616,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed charges against the founder of the EtherDelta cryptocurrency tokens trading platform Zachary Cobern for providing securities exchange services without registration. This writes CoinDesk.  On Thursday, the regulator reported that EtherDelta, acting as a secondary market for ERC20 tokens, provides a platform where buyers and sellers can meet with each other to exchange Ethereum tokens using a public order book, a site for displaying bids and a smart contract developed on the base of Ethereum.  “The EtherDelta smart contract was written in such a way as to validate the messages associated with the applications, confirm the conditions of the applications, execute the matching applications and send updates to the distributed registry so that transactions are reflected in it,” the agency said in a press release.  EtherDelta conducted over 3.6 million transactions over the 18-month period “with ERC20 tokens, including tokens that are considered securities in accordance with federal securities laws.”  “Almost all the applications that were placed on the EtherDelta platform led to the conclusion of transactions after the SEC published a report on The DAO in 2017, where it indicated that certain digital assets, such as DAO tokens, are securities and platforms provide services for the sale of such securities in the form of digital assets, will be subject to SEC requirements, according to which they must register or qualify for an exception to the rules, ”the regulator writes.  The EtherDelta platform was not registered with the SEC and did not declare that it falls under exemptions in the context of US securities laws.  “EtherDelta had a user interface and the core functionality of the national online stock exchange. She had to register with the SEC or be qualified as an exception, ”said Stephanie Avagian, co-head of the SEC law enforcement department.  Coburn did not admit, nor did he reject his guilt and had already paid $ 300,000 of illegally received funds, $ 13,000 as interest for the period prior to the decision, and $ 75,000 fine. SEC noted that Coburn collaborated with the investigation, which led to a reduction in the amount of the fine.

The rating is published monthly, with few exceptions, and covers the leading block project, distributed by several parameters.  The new report has three platforms of decentralized applications (Dapp): EOS remains leader for the third month in a row with 157.3 points; TRON 2 with 139.6; Ethereum 3 with 136.1.  Since the last report in December, Chinese experts' evaluations have changed slightly. TRON took second place, which was formerly EOS, and Bitcoin fell into two positions and is now on the eleventh line, down from NEO and Stem. The latter recently abandoned its own block in favour of the TRON rating.  There's a change in the bottom of the list. Bitcoin Cash fell from 27th place on the 34th. Stratis took over, followed by Monero, Zcash and Cardano. Tezos' rating of Chinese analysts dropped from 26th to 33rd, while the asset was better than its closest competitors on the market.  All projects were evaluated according to the criteria of technologicality, conceptual potential and practical value.  CIID is described as ""a first-class research institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information of the PRC"". However, the higher management does not comment on the crypto-ratings of local experts, who are entitled to issue them at their discretion."

3143644,"In addition to mobile devices, users of the digital renminbi may be offered other arrangements for interaction with the new currency of the People &apos; s Bank of China. It is written by CoinDesk with reference to China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the largest commercial banks in the country, which sets out the rules for the use of the financial instrument.  The agreement was made publicly available during the short activation of the digital renminbi wallet for all CCB clients on the weekend. The text suggests that, in addition to a wallet in a mobile application format, hardware wallets may be offered to users. This will allow large amounts to be stored in digital renminbi without connection to the Internet, which is difficult to implement in a mobile application.  The agreement describes the asset that is activated at the request of the customer at the bank counter or digital channel for the transfer of digital currency. In this regard, the hardware wallet will resemble the usual wallet in which banknotes can be kept. The key difference is that hardware wallets will be available for tracing and will exclude the faceless element that is inherent in cash because their activation will require the provision of personal data.  Such a wallet could still be used for payment, entry and withdrawal of money from bank accounts, as well as for transfer of transactions between users, as stated in the document. It also refers to a four-tier system that will potentially determine how much money the owner may spend.  For example, a second-level wallet would allow up to RMB 10,000 ($1,500) and limit one transaction to less than RMB 5,000. On a day like this, you can't spend more than RMB 10,000, RMB 300,000 ($42,000) a year. Whether any restrictions would apply to first-level wallets was not specified in the document. Nor does the publication state what the level of a wallet will depend on."

It's eight o'clock, and it's basically there, maybe a little bit more.    At the other end of the pencil, there's a griffel sharpener, and you can do it dumbly blind. I suspect that the meibilin didn't freak out and made the shades the same as the ""techsam"" liquid lipsticks. I bought a pencil in ten shades, and it's a little darker than the 65 nudge on the liquid version.

3143651,"  The Slush Pool Mining Pool, in collaboration with Ballet Crypto, will release the blocks it produced on the physical medium as ""girl"" bitcoin.  According to Slush Pol, users will be able to buy blocks at Ballet Crypto to become owners of ""the physical fragment of Bitcoin's history"". Unlike cash, bitcoins have a history. For example, when bitcoin is used in illegal sites like Silk Road, the reputation of such coins is compromised.  The idea of the project is that regulated investment funds will strive to comply strictly with the provisions of the Money Laundering Act. In addition, regulated exchanges will cease to accept coins that have been used in financial crimes or other acts that violate the law. Users and fund managers will not be able to conduct transactions with black or grey coins.  ""black coins"" means a cryptivate whose traces are traced to an address on a blacknet or an address on a blacklist. When placed on regulated exchanges, such coins receive a special mark, and the user may become a figure in the proceedings. Black coins are difficult to convert into a phiat currency. Grey coins are not directly linked to blacklist addresses, but their history cannot be traced fully. Such coins can be mixed through services that increase the confidentiality of transactions.  White coins can be fully traced up to the time they are issued. These coins were not used for illegal purposes or were purchased on a KYC/AML exchange. ""Great"" coins are those that have remained with one holder since their extraction and have never been moved. White coins and virgin coins are much more valuable in the market, and this is an excellent opportunity for engineers to increase their profits.  Unlike over-the-counter cryptivate (OTC) sites, the Ballet Crypto product is not targeted at institutional investors. On the contrary, it is intended for ordinary bitcoin holders, who will have clean coins, and will become holders of a unique collection of bitcoin as digital gold.  According to the project's creators, a two-factor key generation is used for security purposes, where it is encrypted by the BIP38 code phrase. This phrase and the private key are generated off-line and added separately to each block. For example, a wallet is created and added to a block in China and then encrypted by a code phrase in the United States.  Ballet Crypto sends a physical block to the buyer before the coins are produced. Upon confirmation of the buyer's receipt of the block and its ""security"", Ballet Crypto informs Braiins of the unit's mining, and the collection item is ready. Given that such units are ""pre-ordered"", users can purchase a block with a fee of 12.5 BTC prior to the Halving."

An announcement from Malta-based Zebpay, once the largest stock exchange in India, claims to mark the first acceptance of LN payments by a large exchange. Bitcoinist writes about it.  Zebpay clients who can use the service via a web interface and iOS and Android applications are now able to use the BTC wallet balance to perform Lightning transactions. Zebpay emphasizes the need to use a shopping service in Lightning-backed stores and states: ""Users can buy almost anything by choosing a store, copying or scanning a bill for a good or service and completing a payment - all for milliseconds.""  The representatives of the exchange stated that ""Zebpays commissions for Lightning transactions made out of her wallet"". There is, however, a limitation. Users can make up to 10 transactions per day for amounts ranging from 1 satosha to 0.001 BTC (about $4 at current rates). Although this may appear to be a small amount, LN is still being tested and is not recommended for large amounts. Current use options are also largely focused on microtransactions.  ""We believe that crypts empower investors and allow anyone to take responsibility for their financial lives. In proposing trade with a zero commission, we are seeking to free the crypts from the shackles of the trade commissions and reduce the difficulties for the novices of the industry,"" said the CEO of Adjit Huran's company.

3143672,"The New Zealand Tax Authority recognized the payment of salaries in cryptocurrency as legal and provided detailed guidance on the taxation of related transactions, writes Cointelegraph.  In particular, cryptocurrency payments were legalized, which are part of the employee’s fixed salary, fixed by volume or rate, while, for example, dividend payments are not included in this scheme. Also, the permit applies only to settlements with employees - self-employed taxpayers were not included in it.  For the salary paid in cryptocurrency to be taxable, the assets transferred to the employee must not have restrictions associated with their immediate expenditure and be available for conversion into fiat.  “In the current environment, where cryptocurrency assets are not directly accepted for payment of goods and services, the commissioner believes that cryptocurrency assets that are not available for direct conversion into fiat currency on the exchange do not have sufficient signs of money to consider them to be waged,” it says in the document.  Thus, the manual covers cryptocurrencies used in peer-to-peer payment systems, including those tied to fiat currency rates, but not assets that operate on the principle of vouchers, stocks or debt securities.  In June, it became known that a resident of nearby Australia owed the state $ 100,000 of tax on cryptocurrency assets, the real value of which fell to $ 20,000."

3143683,"As a matter of fact, you know, I've been having trouble with the channel for the last couple of months, girlfriends, because in a lot of ways, it's because the TV doesn't grow as fast as the same insta where there's a fidback, like a 2016 cart, when you sit and pack it just because you write about makeup with jokes. But then I remembered that we're punks, and it doesn't matter that the Fallovers have stopped splintering each week, we're already like a big gypsy settlement. And the introverts, which is why you introverted all this fidback on your own.   Secondly, at some point, I'm very tired of makeup. I have her full apartment, and the pleasure was one huge zero. The care was reduced to three or four, and the mike was reduced to four (flomorster and eyebrow gel, subduction, and sometimes mascara, I can't yet use my skin tone).   Third, makeup stopped surpriseing me. Yeah, there's something new coming out every day, but, like they say in a dirty novel, IT'S NO. I don't often use anything anymore, because the same cups are just a side view. The colors are the same, the textures are the same.

3143686,"Former Ripple Technical Director, Stefan Thomas, announced beta testing of the platform for monetization of Coil's web content.  According to Thomas, the new platform is intended to set ""better rules of the game"" for the creators of the web content.  ""If you're a big player, you can sign up for services like Netflix and Spotify. If you're big, you can collect enough data about people to make a lot of money through Facebook or Google commercials, sharing the thoughts of an ex-employer of Ripple. If you're small, it's actually hard to make money on the Internet right now."" According to him, a number of web services have now joined the new platform. In particular, integration with Wikipedia, YouTube and Twitch is taking place.  As a member of the Ripple, Stefan Thomas was involved in the development of the Interledger compatibility protocol, which allows payments to be made on various networks. The same technology is at the core of the Coil platform.  Thomas was also involved in the development of the Ripple smart-contract platform Codius. However, work on the platform had been postponed as early as 2015, owing to technical difficulties as well as the lack of convincing applications. However, in June, Thomas announced that the Codius technology would be included in the Coil.  The new platform allows readers, viewers, and listeners to reward content creators through micro-payments. This model has already been used repeatedly in the blocking industry, including the Brave startup, which last year carried out a $35 million ""lightning"" ICO.  According to Ripple, Coil's decision will open up new business models to content creators where payments are made in real time.  The Coil Startup was one of the new members of the Hyperledger block-consortium."

3143688,"Greetings, lunoli. You're Katerina of Odontso. There's been too much fun lately, including Wednesday-lacomku, Thursday-go-round (and the 8 March corporation) and the R.R. of our founding mother, all of which, despite retrograde mercure, risked turning the carbohydrate window into a carbohydrate black hole that will collapse on Sunday. For the regular Teremka, like me and Katerina, to explain what you don't have to do, and for those who watch as a face every year turn into the exact likeness of a stack of pancakes eaten, hold an ambulance not at the cost of a plane.  *Master Contur face pencil from Maybelline in 01. He has one undeniable advantage -- he doesn't create the effect of someone accidentally touching your cheek with snickers or rusty rebars, 01 shades well laid on almost everyone, so you don't googling the kibbies at the Rivhosh or the Girlfriend's counter, you can just take them.  ♪ Stick's tush properties are his gift, his curse. On the one hand, you can put it out calmly, even in a crowded circuit in the morning, without a mirror and with your hands tied, and on the other hand, it's very easy to take it to zero. So, after the application, I'm waiting for a couple of seconds and a lean brush or a dry sponge like a dry texture (but more often with a finger, of course).  ♪ The cream texture of the norm is on all kinds of skin, but if you're a bleacher (i.e., we're all in the oil season), the color can fly away as fast as you want to live on Monday morning. On the plus side, it doesn't stress the swollen and cheeks. If you're pompous on the top, it's generally normal for the rest of the day.  Now let's take a walk on the back of the medal: 1. Bilateral, he's awful bilateral. Even David Copperfield wouldn't be able to put it in a way that doesn't hurt the second shade. At the same time, the dark one ends faster, and now you're a strong, smart, capable, hater of the whole world. 2. Persistence depends on the degree of dermal extraction and the pond fixation. But with all the strengthening factors, endurance is 6 out of 10. 3. The bright ""hylyteir"" is a very, very, very dense white-colored conspirator, with a matte finish, it doesn't shine, but it closes the pimples perfectly, as well as the hopes for natural makeup. But again, it's tasty.  As a result, it's a good budget for sculpture, with a perfect shade. If there's any doubt, you can go to the nearest cosmetic, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it.

Invest in audits, insurance, and, please, DYOR. - do your own research. Only with loss will you come to education,"" he wrote.  The day before, a DeFi Protocol Harvest Finance had been attacked, and $24 million had been extracted from it through the manipulation of steak prices. The developers subsequently reported that they had contacted large exchanges, including Kraken, to freeze assets if they came into their purses.

Similarly, the Sushi Swap project's current fell by 73% when its creator, known only as Chef Nomi, disposed of assets from a fund designed to finance further development.

The funds were also withdrawn by an unknown person with the help of an Explosion discovered at Eminence.

3143707,"  The US Marshal Service reported the successful completion of the auction for the sale of 4,040 bitcoins.  Participants were asked to purchase four lots for 2,500 BTC, 1,000 BTC, 500 BTC, and 40.54069820 BTC. A total of 18 people took part in the event, placing 38 stakes. The winner was only two.

The U.S. Marshal Service, an American variation of the bailiff service, announced an auction on 1 February. Potential participants had nine days to register by e-mail, which was also used to place the rates. In addition, each of them was required to make a security deposit of $200,000.  Bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp calculated that over a six-year period, the U.S. government sold 185 230 BTCs from a hammer, generating $151 million. At the same time, the potential benefit of selling all these bitcoins at the current rate could be about $1.8 billion. The first auction in 2014 was attended by venture capitalist Tim Draper, who was then able to purchase 29,657 BTC.  Also this week, it was reported that the Irish police ""confiscated the Bitcoin purses"" of a drug dealer with 6,000 BTCs or about $58 million.

The U.S. NuCypher block-starter has completed the distribution of its NU virtual current to more than 2,000 potential nose operators who provided over $125 million in ethereum (ETH) during September for protocol purposes. The main network of the project is scheduled to be operational as early as 15 October.   NuCyfer is a graduate of the Y Combinator business incubator. Startup entered the market in 2015 and works to help developers of decentralized applications (dApp) store, transfer and manage user personal data in the public locker.   Last October, the startup attracted $10.67 million by selling SAFT contracts. ===Polichain Capital===Leed was the hedge fund of the Polychain Capital, and among the investors were the above-mentioned Y Combinator and Bitmain Mining Company.   The NuCyfer infrastructure is based on two technologies: Umbral PRE and NuFHE. The first is a method of re-encrypting a proxie server, which allows data to be kept encrypted and protected against third parties, but at the same time available for transmission by the approved sender under certain conditions. The second is a type of complete homomorphic encryption that allows you to process encrypted data without having to decrypt them.   NuCyfer's nose operators are paid to maintain the locker. In order to influence the operation of the protocol, knots must be involved in the glassing of NU currents. The start-up team had to distribute the currents to organizations that it could reasonably expect to participate upon the launch of the main network. It was for that purpose that WorkLock was launched.   WorkLock is a special smart contract designed to distribute nodes after the main network is launched. The essence of the mechanism is that users pay to the smart contract address ETH, which has been blocked for six months since the start of the maintenant. In return, they receive NU currents that can be used to control network nodes.  After six months, participants can choose whether to return the deposits or continue to participate in the NU glassing. However, if they decide to leave early or ""act maliciously"", they will have to lose their ETH."

3143728,"  Raul Pal, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, believes that the recent fall of Bitcoin does not signal the disillusionment of investors. In the next 12 to 18 months, we'll see the BTC repeat the famous December 2017 Rally.  Let's remind you, the coin at some commercial sites was $20,000. This is the point of view that Pal made in his recent interview with an industry expert, Stefan Livera, published at the end of last week.  The former top manager of Goldman Sachs, currently head of Real Vision, made similar statements earlier.  In early February, for example, he predicted that Bitcoin would be the best investment in 2020. Despite the high risks of volatility, investing in Bitcoin is still very profitable.  In a conversation with Liver, Pal stressed that equity investments, for example, are also risky, but the return on such investments is very low compared to bitcoin and other digital currencies. Even real estate investments are less promising than buying a BTC that represents the best asset class.  On Monday night, March 23, the first cryptation went below $6,000. There is now a market correction that has changed trade in the green zone, resulting in a $6,680 mark on the evening of March 20."

3143730,"👀 The past couple of weeks have not abated the discussion around the news that the CBOE again applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the opening of bitcoin-ETF. The Chicago Stock Exchange plans to trade bitcoin-shares, each of which will cost 25 BTC.  🤔 What is ETF? The exchange-traded fund is investment funds, which are traded on the stock exchange in the form of their shares (more precisely, units). ETF as an investment tool became widespread in the US in the 1990s. The main advantage of ETF is that investors do not need to register on exchanges and buy crypto-currencies, they only need to give money to the fund, which will buy coins. Everyone who has bought securities of such a fund will be considered the owner of a part of assets and receive dividends.  👆 Will the ETF increase the cost of Bitcoin (BTC)? The permission to create bitcoin-ETF will open the doors of the crypto-currency market for a large number of investors who will receive a simple and easy investment tool. There is a possibility that with the opening of the ETF, the BTC will rise sharply to $ 10,000 or even $ 20,000.  ✅ Is there a confirmation of the effect of ETF on the value of the asset? In 2003, the first-of-its-kind ETF for precious metals was introduced in the stock markets. ETFs secured by gold quickly gained popularity, and eight years later - by the time of the peak gold prices in 2011 - they accumulated a record 2,500 tons of metal for a total of $ 120 billion at those prices.  📆 In the event that the SEC and approves the creation of bitcoin-ETF, it is likely that its launch will occur no earlier than the end of 2018 - early 2019.

3143743,"Cambridge University published a second comparative study of corporate blocks, which collected data from more than 200 enterprises, startups, central banks and other public sector institutions in 59 countries between July 2018 and June 2019.  One section of the survey focused on corporate projects in the block office. Following a review of 67 existing networks, researchers concluded that 43 per cent of blockages are used in financial projects, such as clearing and reconciliation of records.  However, researchers have found that most projects have been developed for quite some time. On average, about 25 months go from proof of concept to deployment, and larger networks may take more than four years to build.  Corporate blocks are much more centralized than their open counterparts. This means that instead of thousands of anonymous nodes and engineers providing security for the block, one or more nodes agree on the content of the new blocks and the existing chain.  Controlled blocks, which provide greater control over networks and a high level of confidentiality, are important in industries where data are a commercial secret. In this case, however, there is a concern that centralization will provide the lead organizations with an unfair advantage and potentially block access by other participants to aggregated results.  Cambridge researchers found that more than 80 per cent of corporate projects used only one blocker deployment service to launch knots and engineering. Forty-eight per cent of the projects reviewed are based on the IBM Hyperledger Fabric block, while 15 per cent are based on the Corda of R3.  According to the report, market leaders developed more than 70 per cent of corporate projects on the block in the hope that other companies would join them in their industries. Industry consortia deployed 22 per cent of corporate blocks and just over 5 per cent were established by government agencies. Working under the auspices of market leaders allows some corporate networks to grow faster, but they may find it difficult to attract competitors to their platform.  In addition to the financial sphere, blockages are often used to track supply chains. Recently, the Austrian manufacturer Gina Steen announced that he intended to use NFC technology and ICON lockdown to track bottles and the transparency of the supply chain. In addition, in August, the U.S. Minselkhoz announced that he would monitor organic products through a block-chamber."
